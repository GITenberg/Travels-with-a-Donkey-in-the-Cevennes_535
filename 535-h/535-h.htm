<p>My Dear Sidney Colvin,</p>
<p>The journey which this little book is to describe was very agreeable
and fortunate for me.&nbsp; After an uncouth beginning, I had the best
of luck to the end.&nbsp; But we are all travellers in what John Bunyan
calls the wilderness of this world&mdash;all, too, travellers with a
donkey: and the best that we find in our travels is an honest friend.&nbsp;
He is a fortunate voyager who finds many.&nbsp; We travel, indeed, to
find them.&nbsp; They are the end and the reward of life.&nbsp; They
keep us worthy of ourselves; and when we are alone, we are only nearer
to the absent.</p>
<p>Every book is, in an intimate sense, a circular letter to the friends
of him who writes it.&nbsp; They alone take his meaning; they find private
messages, assurances of love, and expressions of gratitude, dropped
for them in every corner.&nbsp; The public is but a generous patron
who defrays the postage.&nbsp; Yet though the letter is directed to
all, we have an old and kindly custom of addressing it on the outside
to one.&nbsp; Of what shall a man be proud, if he is not proud of his
friends?&nbsp; And so, my dear Sidney Colvin, it is with pride that
I sign myself affectionately yours,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>

<h3>THE DONKEY, THE PACK, AND THE PACK-SADDLE</h3>
<p>In a little place called Le Monastier, in a pleasant highland valley
fifteen miles from Le Puy, I spent about a month of fine days.&nbsp;
Monastier is notable for the making of lace, for drunkenness, for freedom
of language, and for unparalleled political dissension.&nbsp; There
are adherents of each of the four French parties&mdash;Legitimists,
Orleanists, Imperialists, and Republicans&mdash;in this little mountain-town;
and they all hate, loathe, decry, and calumniate each other.&nbsp; Except
for business purposes, or to give each other the lie in a tavern brawl,
they have laid aside even the civility of speech.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
mere mountain Poland.&nbsp; In the midst of this Babylon I found myself
a rallying-point; every one was anxious to be kind and helpful to the
stranger.&nbsp; This was not merely from the natural hospitality of
mountain people, nor even from the surprise with which I was regarded
as a man living of his own free will in Le Monastier, when he might
just as well have lived anywhere else in this big world; it arose a
good deal from my projected excursion southward through the Cevennes.&nbsp;
A traveller of my sort was a thing hitherto unheard of in that district.&nbsp;
I was looked upon with contempt, like a man who should project a journey
to the moon, but yet with a respectful interest, like one setting forth
for the inclement Pole.&nbsp; All were ready to help in my preparations;
a crowd of sympathisers supported me at the critical moment of a bargain;
not a step was taken but was heralded by glasses round and celebrated
by a dinner or a breakfast.</p>
<p>It was already hard upon October before I was ready to set forth,
and at the high altitudes over which my road lay there was no Indian
summer to be looked for.&nbsp; I was determined, if not to camp out,
at least to have the means of camping out in my possession; for there
is nothing more harassing to an easy mind than the necessity of reaching
shelter by dusk, and the hospitality of a village inn is not always
to be reckoned sure by those who trudge on foot.&nbsp; A tent, above
all for a solitary traveller, is troublesome to pitch, and troublesome
to strike again; and even on the march it forms a conspicuous feature
in your baggage.&nbsp; A sleeping-sack, on the other hand, is always
ready&mdash;you have only to get into it; it serves a double purpose&mdash;a
bed by night, a portmanteau by day; and it does not advertise your intention
of camping out to every curious passer-by.&nbsp; This is a huge point.&nbsp;
If a camp is not secret, it is but a troubled resting-place; you become
a public character; the convivial rustic visits your bedside after an
early supper; and you must sleep with one eye open, and be up before
the day.&nbsp; I decided on a sleeping-sack; and after repeated visits
to Le Puy, and a deal of high living for myself and my advisers, a sleeping-sack
was designed, constructed, and triumphantly brought home.</p>
<p>This child of my invention was nearly six feet square, exclusive
of two triangular flaps to serve as a pillow by night and as the top
and bottom of the sack by day.&nbsp; I call it &lsquo;the sack,&rsquo;
but it was never a sack by more than courtesy: only a sort of long roll
or sausage, green waterproof cart-cloth without and blue sheep&rsquo;s
fur within.&nbsp; It was commodious as a valise, warm and dry for a
bed.&nbsp; There was luxurious turning room for one; and at a pinch
the thing might serve for two.&nbsp; I could bury myself in it up to
the neck; for my head I trusted to a fur cap, with a hood to fold down
over my ears and a band to pass under my nose like a respirator; and
in case of heavy rain I proposed to make myself a little tent, or tentlet,
with my waterproof coat, three stones, and a bent branch.</p>
<p>It will readily be conceived that I could not carry this huge package
on my own, merely human, shoulders.&nbsp; It remained to choose a beast
of burden.&nbsp; Now, a horse is a fine lady among animals, flighty,
timid, delicate in eating, of tender health; he is too valuable and
too restive to be left alone, so that you are chained to your brute
as to a fellow galley-slave; a dangerous road puts him out of his wits;
in short, he&rsquo;s an uncertain and exacting ally, and adds thirty-fold
to the troubles of the voyager.&nbsp; What I required was something
cheap and small and hardy, and of a stolid and peaceful temper; and
all these requisites pointed to a donkey.</p>
<p>There dwelt an old man in Monastier, of rather unsound intellect
according to some, much followed by street-boys, and known to fame as
Father Adam.&nbsp; Father Adam had a cart, and to draw the cart a diminutive
she-ass, not much bigger than a dog, the colour of a mouse, with a kindly
eye and a determined under-jaw.&nbsp; There was something neat and high-bred,
a quakerish elegance, about the rogue that hit my fancy on the spot.&nbsp;
Our first interview was in Monastier market-place.&nbsp; To prove her
good temper, one child after another was set upon her back to ride,
and one after another went head over heels into the air; until a want
of confidence began to reign in youthful bosoms, and the experiment
was discontinued from a dearth of subjects.&nbsp; I was already backed
by a deputation of my friends; but as if this were not enough, all the
buyers and sellers came round and helped me in the bargain; and the
ass and I and Father Adam were the centre of a hubbub for near half
an hour.&nbsp; At length she passed into my service for the consideration
of sixty-five francs and a glass of brandy.&nbsp; The sack had already
cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer; so that Modestine, as I
instantly baptized her, was upon all accounts the cheaper article.&nbsp;
Indeed, that was as it should be; for she was only an appurtenance of
my mattress, or self-acting bedstead on four castors.</p>
<p>I had a last interview with Father Adam in a billiard-room at the
witching hour of dawn, when I administered the brandy.&nbsp; He professed
himself greatly touched by the separation, and declared he had often
bought white bread for the donkey when he had been content with black
bread for himself; but this, according to the best authorities, must
have been a flight of fancy.&nbsp; He had a name in the village for
brutally misusing the ass; yet it is certain that he shed a tear, and
the tear made a clean mark down one cheek.</p>
<p>By the advice of a fallacious local saddler, a leather pad was made
for me with rings to fasten on my bundle; and I thoughtfully completed
my kit and arranged my toilette.&nbsp; By way of armoury and utensils,
I took a revolver, a little spirit-lamp and pan, a lantern and some
halfpenny candles, a jack-knife and a large leather flask.&nbsp; The
main cargo consisted of two entire changes of warm clothing&mdash;besides
my travelling wear of country velveteen, pilot-coat, and knitted spencer&mdash;some
books, and my railway-rug, which, being also in the form of a bag, made
me a double castle for cold nights.&nbsp; The permanent larder was represented
by cakes of chocolate and tins of Bologna sausage.&nbsp; All this, except
what I carried about my person, was easily stowed into the sheepskin
bag; and by good fortune I threw in my empty knapsack, rather for convenience
of carriage than from any thought that I should want it on my journey.&nbsp;
For more immediate needs I took a leg of cold mutton, a bottle of Beaujolais,
an empty bottle to carry milk, an egg-beater, and a considerable quantity
of black bread and white, like Father Adam, for myself and donkey, only
in my scheme of things the destinations were reversed.</p>
<p>Monastrians, of all shades of thought in politics, had agreed in
threatening me with many ludicrous misadventures, and with sudden death
in many surprising forms.&nbsp; Cold, wolves, robbers, above all the
nocturnal practical joker, were daily and eloquently forced on my attention.&nbsp;
Yet in these vaticinations, the true, patent danger was left out.&nbsp;
Like Christian, it was from my pack I suffered by the way.&nbsp; Before
telling my own mishaps, let me in two words relate the lesson of my
experience.&nbsp; If the pack is well strapped at the ends, and hung
at full length&mdash;not doubled, for your life&mdash;across the pack-saddle,
the traveller is safe.&nbsp; The saddle will certainly not fit, such
is the imperfection of our transitory life; it will assuredly topple
and tend to overset; but there are stones on every roadside, and a man
soon learns the art of correcting any tendency to overbalance with a
well-adjusted stone.</p>
<p>On the day of my departure I was up a little after five; by six,
we began to load the donkey; and ten minutes after, my hopes were in
the dust.&nbsp; The pad would not stay on Modestine&rsquo;s back for
half a moment.&nbsp; I returned it to its maker, with whom I had so
contumelious a passage that the street outside was crowded from wall
to wall with gossips looking on and listening.&nbsp; The pad changed
hands with much vivacity; perhaps it would be more descriptive to say
that we threw it at each other&rsquo;s heads; and, at any rate, we were
very warm and unfriendly, and spoke with a deal of freedom.</p>
<p>I had a common donkey pack-saddle&mdash;a <i>barde</i>, as they call
it&mdash;fitted upon Modestine; and once more loaded her with my effects.&nbsp;
The doubled sack, my pilot-coat (for it was warm, and I was to walk
in my waistcoat), a great bar of black bread, and an open basket containing
the white bread, the mutton, and the bottles, were all corded together
in a very elaborate system of knots, and I looked on the result with
fatuous content.&nbsp; In such a monstrous deck-cargo, all poised above
the donkey&rsquo;s shoulders, with nothing below to balance, on a brand-new
pack-saddle that had not yet been worn to fit the animal, and fastened
with brand-new girths that might be expected to stretch and slacken
by the way, even a very careless traveller should have seen disaster
brewing.&nbsp; That elaborate system of knots, again, was the work of
too many sympathisers to be very artfully designed.&nbsp; It is true
they tightened the cords with a will; as many as three at a time would
have a foot against Modestine&rsquo;s quarters, and be hauling with
clenched teeth; but I learned afterwards that one thoughtful person,
without any exercise of force, can make a more solid job than half-a-dozen
heated and enthusiastic grooms.&nbsp; I was then but a novice; even
after the misadventure of the pad nothing could disturb my security,
and I went forth from the stable door as an ox goeth to the slaughter.</p>
<h3>THE GREEN DONKEY-DRIVER</h3>
<p>The bell of Monastier was just striking nine as I got quit of these
preliminary troubles and descended the hill through the common.&nbsp;
As long as I was within sight of the windows, a secret shame and the
fear of some laughable defeat withheld me from tampering with Modestine.&nbsp;
She tripped along upon her four small hoofs with a sober daintiness
of gait; from time to time she shook her ears or her tail; and she looked
so small under the bundle that my mind misgave me.&nbsp; We got across
the ford without difficulty&mdash;there was no doubt about the matter,
she was docility itself&mdash;and once on the other bank, where the
road begins to mount through pine-woods, I took in my right hand the
unhallowed staff, and with a quaking spirit applied it to the donkey.&nbsp;
Modestine brisked up her pace for perhaps three steps, and then relapsed
into her former minuet.&nbsp; Another application had the same effect,
and so with the third.&nbsp; I am worthy the name of an Englishman,
and it goes against my conscience to lay my hand rudely on a female.&nbsp;
I desisted, and looked her all over from head to foot; the poor brute&rsquo;s
knees were trembling and her breathing was distressed; it was plain
that she could go no faster on a hill.&nbsp; God forbid, thought I,
that I should brutalise this innocent creature; let her go at her own
pace, and let me patiently follow.</p>
<p>What that pace was, there is no word mean enough to describe; it
was something as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a
run; it kept me hanging on each foot for an incredible length of time;
in five minutes it exhausted the spirit and set up a fever in all the
muscles of the leg.&nbsp; And yet I had to keep close at hand and measure
my advance exactly upon hers; for if I dropped a few yards into the
rear, or went on a few yards ahead, Modestine came instantly to a halt
and began to browse.&nbsp; The thought that this was to last from here
to Alais nearly broke my heart.&nbsp; Of all conceivable journeys, this
promised to be the most tedious.&nbsp; I tried to tell myself it was
a lovely day; I tried to charm my foreboding spirit with tobacco; but
I had a vision ever present to me of the long, long roads, up hill and
down dale, and a pair of figures ever infinitesimally moving, foot by
foot, a yard to the minute, and, like things enchanted in a nightmare,
approaching no nearer to the goal.</p>
<p>In the meantime there came up behind us a tall peasant, perhaps forty
years of age, of an ironical snuffy countenance, and arrayed in the
green tail-coat of the country.&nbsp; He overtook us hand over hand,
and stopped to consider our pitiful advance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your donkey,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is very old?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I told him, I believed not.</p>
<p>Then, he supposed, we had come far.</p>
<p>I told him, we had but newly left Monastier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Et vous marchez comme</i> <i>&ccedil;a</i>!&rsquo; cried
he; and, throwing back his head, he laughed long and heartily.&nbsp;
I watched him, half prepared to feel offended, until he had satisfied
his mirth; and then, &lsquo;You must have no pity on these animals,&rsquo;
said he; and, plucking a switch out of a thicket, he began to lace Modestine
about the stern-works, uttering a cry.&nbsp; The rogue pricked up her
ears and broke into a good round pace, which she kept up without flagging,
and without exhibiting the least symptom of distress, as long as the
peasant kept beside us.&nbsp; Her former panting and shaking had been,
I regret to say, a piece of comedy.</p>
<p>My<i> deus ex machin&acirc;</i>, before he left me, supplied some
excellent, if inhumane, advice; presented me with the switch, which
he declared she would feel more tenderly than my cane; and finally taught
me the true cry or masonic word of donkey-drivers, &lsquo;Proot!&rsquo;&nbsp;
All the time, he regarded me with a comical, incredulous air, which
was embarrassing to confront; and smiled over my donkey-driving, as
I might have smiled over his orthography, or his green tail-coat.&nbsp;
But it was not my turn for the moment.</p>
<p>I was proud of my new lore, and thought I had learned the art to
perfection.&nbsp; And certainly Modestine did wonders for the rest of
the fore-noon, and I had a breathing space to look about me.&nbsp; It
was Sabbath; the mountain-fields were all vacant in the sunshine; and
as we came down through St. Martin de Frug&egrave;res, the church was
crowded to the door, there were people kneeling without upon the steps,
and the sound of the priest&rsquo;s chanting came forth out of the dim
interior.&nbsp; It gave me a home feeling on the spot; for I am a countryman
of the Sabbath, so to speak, and all Sabbath observances, like a Scottish
accent, strike in me mixed feelings, grateful and the reverse.&nbsp;
It is only a traveller, hurrying by like a person from another planet,
who can rightly enjoy the peace and beauty of the great ascetic feast.&nbsp;
The sight of the resting country does his spirit good.&nbsp; There is
something better than music in the wide unusual silence; and it disposes
him to amiable thoughts, like the sound of a little river or the warmth
of sunlight.</p>
<p>In this pleasant humour I came down the hill to where Goudet stands
in a green end of a valley, with Ch&acirc;teau Beaufort opposite upon
a rocky steep, and the stream, as clear as crystal, lying in a deep
pool between them.&nbsp; Above and below, you may hear it wimpling over
the stones, an amiable stripling of a river, which it seems absurd to
call the Loire.&nbsp; On all sides, Goudet is shut in by mountains;
rocky footpaths, practicable at best for donkeys, join it to the outer
world of France; and the men and women drink and swear, in their green
corner, or look up at the snow-clad peaks in winter from the threshold
of their homes, in an isolation, you would think, like that of Homer&rsquo;s
Cyclops.&nbsp; But it is not so; the postman reaches Goudet with the
letter-bag; the aspiring youth of Goudet are within a day&rsquo;s walk
of the railway at Le Puy; and here in the inn you may find an engraved
portrait of the host&rsquo;s nephew, R&eacute;gis Senac, &lsquo;Professor
of Fencing and Champion of the two Americas,&rsquo; a distinction gained
by him, along with the sum of five hundred dollars, at Tammany Hall,
New York, on the 10th April 1876.</p>
<p>I hurried over my midday meal, and was early forth again.&nbsp; But,
alas, as we climbed the interminable hill upon the other side, &lsquo;Proot!&rsquo;
seemed to have lost its virtue.&nbsp; I prooted like a lion, I prooted
mellifluously like a sucking-dove; but Modestine would be neither softened
nor intimidated.&nbsp; She held doggedly to her pace; nothing but a
blow would move her, and that only for a second.&nbsp; I must follow
at her heels, incessantly belabouring.&nbsp; A moment&rsquo;s pause
in this ignoble toil, and she relapsed into her own private gait.&nbsp;
I think I never heard of any one in as mean a situation.&nbsp; I must
reach the lake of Bouchet, where I meant to camp, before sundown, and,
to have even a hope of this, I must instantly maltreat this uncomplaining
animal.&nbsp; The sound of my own blows sickened me.&nbsp; Once, when
I looked at her, she had a faint resemblance to a lady of my acquaintance
who formerly loaded me with kindness; and this increased my horror of
my cruelty.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, we encountered another donkey, ranging at
will upon the roadside; and this other donkey chanced to be a gentleman.&nbsp;
He and Modestine met nickering for joy, and I had to separate the pair
and beat down their young romance with a renewed and feverish bastinado.&nbsp;
If the other donkey had had the heart of a male under his hide, he would
have fallen upon me tooth and hoof; and this was a kind of consolation&mdash;he
was plainly unworthy of Modestine&rsquo;s affection.&nbsp; But the incident
saddened me, as did everything that spoke of my donkey&rsquo;s sex.</p>
<p>It was blazing hot up the valley, windless, with vehement sun upon
my shoulders; and I had to labour so consistently with my stick that
the sweat ran into my eyes.&nbsp; Every five minutes, too, the pack,
the basket, and the pilot-coat would take an ugly slew to one side or
the other; and I had to stop Modestine, just when I had got her to a
tolerable pace of about two miles an hour, to tug, push, shoulder, and
readjust the load.&nbsp; And at last, in the village of Ussel, saddle
and all, the whole hypothec turned round and grovelled in the dust below
the donkey&rsquo;s belly.&nbsp; She, none better pleased, incontinently
drew up and seemed to smile; and a party of one man, two women, and
two children came up, and, standing round me in a half-circle, encouraged
her by their example.</p>
<p>I had the devil&rsquo;s own trouble to get the thing righted; and
the instant I had done so, without hesitation, it toppled and fell down
upon the other side.&nbsp; Judge if I was hot!&nbsp; And yet not a hand
was offered to assist me.&nbsp; The man, indeed, told me I ought to
have a package of a different shape.&nbsp; I suggested, if he knew nothing
better to the point in my predicament, he might hold his tongue.&nbsp;
And the good-natured dog agreed with me smilingly.&nbsp; It was the
most despicable fix.&nbsp; I must plainly content myself with the pack
for Modestine, and take the following items for my own share of the
portage: a cane, a quart-flask, a pilot-jacket heavily weighted in the
pockets, two pounds of black bread, and an open basket full of meats
and bottles.&nbsp; I believe I may say I am not devoid of greatness
of soul; for I did not recoil from this infamous burden.&nbsp; I disposed
it, Heaven knows how, so as to be mildly portable, and then proceeded
to steer Modestine through the village.&nbsp; She tried, as was indeed
her invariable habit, to enter every house and every courtyard in the
whole length; and, encumbered as I was, without a hand to help myself,
no words can render an idea of my difficulties.&nbsp; A priest, with
six or seven others, was examining a church in process of repair, and
he and his acolytes laughed loudly as they saw my plight.</p>
<p>I remembered having laughed myself when I had seen good men struggling
with adversity in the person of a jackass, and the recollection filled
me with penitence.&nbsp; That was in my old light days, before this
trouble came upon me.&nbsp; God knows at least that I shall never laugh
again, thought I.&nbsp; But oh, what a cruel thing is a farce to those
engaged in it!</p>
<p>A little out of the village, Modestine, filled with the demon, set
her heart upon a by-road, and positively refused to leave it.&nbsp;
I dropped all my bundles, and, I am ashamed to say, struck the poor
sinner twice across the face.&nbsp; It was pitiful to see her lift her
head with shut eyes, as if waiting for another blow.&nbsp; I came very
near crying; but I did a wiser thing than that, and sat squarely down
by the roadside to consider my situation under the cheerful influence
of tobacco and a nip of brandy.&nbsp; Modestine, in the meanwhile, munched
some black bread with a contrite hypocritical air.&nbsp; It was plain
that I must make a sacrifice to the gods of shipwreck.&nbsp; I threw
away the empty bottle destined to carry milk; I threw away my own white
bread, and, disdaining to act by general average, kept the black bread
for Modestine; lastly, I threw away the cold leg of mutton and the egg-whisk,
although this last was dear to my heart.&nbsp; Thus I found room for
everything in the basket, and even stowed the boating-coat on the top.&nbsp;
By means of an end of cord I slung it under one arm; and although the
cord cut my shoulder, and the jacket hung almost to the ground, it was
with a heart greatly lightened that I set forth again.</p>
<p>I had now an arm free to thrash Modestine, and cruelly I chastised
her.&nbsp; If I were to reach the lakeside before dark, she must bestir
her little shanks to some tune.&nbsp; Already the sun had gone down
into a windy-looking mist; and although there were still a few streaks
of gold far off to the east on the hills and the black fir-woods, all
was cold and grey about our onward path.&nbsp; An infinity of little
country by-roads led hither and thither among the fields.&nbsp; It was
the most pointless labyrinth.&nbsp; I could see my destination overhead,
or rather the peak that dominates it; but choose as I pleased, the roads
always ended by turning away from it, and sneaking back towards the
valley, or northward along the margin of the hills.&nbsp; The failing
light, the waning colour, the naked, unhomely, stony country through
which I was travelling, threw me into some despondency.&nbsp; I promise
you, the stick was not idle; I think every decent step that Modestine
took must have cost me at least two emphatic blows.&nbsp; There was
not another sound in the neighbourhood but that of my unwearying bastinado.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the midst of my toils, the load once more bit the dust,
and, as by enchantment, all the cords were simultaneously loosened,
and the road scattered with my dear possessions.&nbsp; The packing was
to begin again from the beginning; and as I had to invent a new and
better system, I do not doubt but I lost half an hour.&nbsp; It began
to be dusk in earnest as I reached a wilderness of turf and stones.&nbsp;
It had the air of being a road which should lead everywhere at the same
time; and I was falling into something not unlike despair when I saw
two figures stalking towards me over the stones.&nbsp; They walked one
behind the other like tramps, but their pace was remarkable.&nbsp; The
son led the way, a tall, ill-made, sombre, Scottish-looking man; the
mother followed, all in her Sunday&rsquo;s best, with an elegantly embroidered
ribbon to her cap, and a new felt hat atop, and proffering, as she strode
along with kilted petticoats, a string of obscene and blasphemous oaths.</p>
<p>I hailed the son, and asked him my direction.&nbsp; He pointed loosely
west and north-west, muttered an inaudible comment, and, without slackening
his pace for an instant, stalked on, as he was going, right athwart
my path.&nbsp; The mother followed without so much as raising her head.&nbsp;
I shouted and shouted after them, but they continued to scale the hillside,
and turned a deaf ear to my outcries.&nbsp; At last, leaving Modestine
by herself, I was constrained to run after them, hailing the while.&nbsp;
They stopped as I drew near, the mother still cursing; and I could see
she was a handsome, motherly, respectable-looking woman.&nbsp; The son
once more answered me roughly and inaudibly, and was for setting out
again.&nbsp; But this time I simply collared the mother, who was nearest
me, and, apologising for my violence, declared that I could not let
them go until they had put me on my road.&nbsp; They were neither of
them offended&mdash;rather mollified than otherwise; told me I had only
to follow them; and then the mother asked me what I wanted by the lake
at such an hour.&nbsp; I replied, in the Scottish manner, by inquiring
if she had far to go herself.&nbsp; She told me, with another oath,
that she had an hour and a half&rsquo;s road before her.&nbsp; And then,
without salutation, the pair strode forward again up the hillside in
the gathering dusk.</p>
<p>I returned for Modestine, pushed her briskly forward, and, after
a sharp ascent of twenty minutes, reached the edge of a plateau.&nbsp;
The view, looking back on my day&rsquo;s journey, was both wild and
sad.&nbsp; Mount M&eacute;zenc and the peaks beyond St. Julien stood
out in trenchant gloom against a cold glitter in the east; and the intervening
field of hills had fallen together into one broad wash of shadow, except
here and there the outline of a wooded sugar-loaf in black, here and
there a white irregular patch to represent a cultivated farm, and here
and there a blot where the Loire, the Gazeille, or the Laussonne wandered
in a gorge.</p>
<p>Soon we were on a high-road, and surprise seized on my mind as I
beheld a village of some magnitude close at hand; for I had been told
that the neighbourhood of the lake was uninhabited except by trout.&nbsp;
The road smoked in the twilight with children driving home cattle from
the fields; and a pair of mounted stride-legged women, hat and cap and
all, dashed past me at a hammering trot from the canton where they had
been to church and market.&nbsp; I asked one of the children where I
was.&nbsp; At Bouchet St. Nicolas, he told me.&nbsp; Thither, about
a mile south of my destination, and on the other side of a respectable
summit, had these confused roads and treacherous peasantry conducted
me.&nbsp; My shoulder was cut, so that it hurt sharply; my arm ached
like toothache from perpetual beating; I gave up the lake and my design
to camp, and asked for the <i>auberge.</i></p>
<h3>I HAVE A GOAD</h3>
<p>The<i> auberge</i> of Bouchet St. Nicolas was among the least pretentious
I have ever visited; but I saw many more of the like upon my journey.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was typical of these French highlands.&nbsp; Imagine a cottage
of two stories, with a bench before the door; the stable and kitchen
in a suite, so that Modestine and I could hear each other dining; furniture
of the plainest, earthern floors, a single bedchamber for travellers,
and that without any convenience but beds.&nbsp; In the kitchen cooking
and eating go forward side by side, and the family sleep at night.&nbsp;
Any one who has a fancy to wash must do so in public at the common table.&nbsp;
The food is sometimes spare; hard fish and omelette have been my portion
more than once; the wine is of the smallest, the brandy abominable to
man; and the visit of a fat sow, grouting under the table and rubbing
against your legs, is no impossible accompaniment to dinner.</p>
<p>But the people of the inn, in nine cases out of ten, show themselves
friendly and considerate.&nbsp; As soon as you cross the doors you cease
to be a stranger; and although these peasantry are rude and forbidding
on the highway, they show a tincture of kind breeding when you share
their hearth.&nbsp; At Bouchet, for instance, I uncorked my bottle of
Beaujolais, and asked the host to join me.&nbsp; He would take but little.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am an amateur of such wine, do you see?&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and I am capable of leaving you not enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In these hedge-inns the traveller is expected to eat with his own
knife; unless he ask, no other will be supplied: with a glass, a whang
of bread, and an iron fork, the table is completely laid.&nbsp; My knife
was cordially admired by the landlord of Bouchet, and the spring filled
him with wonder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should never have guessed that,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
would bet,&rsquo; he added, weighing it in his hand, &lsquo;that this
cost you not less than five francs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When I told him it had cost me twenty, his jaw dropped.</p>
<p>He was a mild, handsome, sensible, friendly old man, astonishingly
ignorant.&nbsp; His wife, who was not so pleasant in her manners, knew
how to read, although I do not suppose she ever did so.&nbsp; She had
a share of brains and spoke with a cutting emphasis, like one who ruled
the roast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My man knows nothing,&rsquo; she said, with an angry nod;
&lsquo;he is like the beasts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the old gentleman signified acquiescence with his head.&nbsp;
There was no contempt on her part, and no shame on his; the facts were
accepted loyally, and no more about the matter.</p>
<p>I was tightly cross-examined about my journey; and the lady understood
in a moment, and sketched out what I should put into my book when I
got home.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whether people harvest or not in such or such
a place; if there were forests; studies of manners; what, for example,
I and the master of the house say to you; the beauties of Nature, and
all that.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she interrogated me with a look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just that,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; she added to her husband, &lsquo;I understood
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were both much interested by the story of my misadventures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the morning,&rsquo; said the husband, &lsquo;I will make
you something better than your cane.&nbsp; Such a beast as that feels
nothing; it is in the proverb&mdash;<i>dur comme un</i> <i>&acirc;ne</i>;
you might beat her insensible with a cudgel, and yet you would arrive
nowhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Something better!&nbsp; I little knew what he was offering.</p>
<p>The sleeping-room was furnished with two beds.&nbsp; I had one; and
I will own I was a little abashed to find a young man and his wife and
child in the act of mounting into the other.&nbsp; This was my first
experience of the sort; and if I am always to feel equally silly and
extraneous, I pray God it be my last as well.&nbsp; I kept my eyes to
myself, and know nothing of the woman except that she had beautiful
arms, and seemed no whit embarrassed by my appearance.&nbsp; As a matter
of fact, the situation was more trying to me than to the pair.&nbsp;
A pair keep each other in countenance; it is the single gentleman who
has to blush.&nbsp; But I could not help attributing my sentiments to
the husband, and sought to conciliate his tolerance with a cup of brandy
from my flask.&nbsp; He told me that he was a cooper of Alais travelling
to St. Etienne in search of work, and that in his spare moments he followed
the fatal calling of a maker of matches.&nbsp; Me he readily enough
divined to be a brandy merchant.</p>
<p>I was up first in the morning (Monday, September 23rd), and hastened
my toilette guiltily, so as to leave a clear field for madam, the cooper&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; I drank a bowl of milk, and set off to explore the neighbourhood
of Bouchet.&nbsp; It was perishing cold, a grey, windy, wintry morning;
misty clouds flew fast and low; the wind piped over the naked platform;
and the only speck of colour was away behind Mount M&eacute;zenc and
the eastern hills, where the sky still wore the orange of the dawn.</p>
<p>It was five in the morning, and four thousand feet above the sea;
and I had to bury my hands in my pockets and trot.&nbsp; People were
trooping out to the labours of the field by twos and threes, and all
turned round to stare upon the stranger.&nbsp; I had seen them coming
back last night, I saw them going afield again; and there was the life
of Bouchet in a nutshell.</p>
<p>When I came back to the inn for a bit of breakfast, the landlady
was in the kitchen combing out her daughter&rsquo;s hair; and I made
her my compliments upon its beauty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; said the mother; &lsquo;it is not so beautiful
as it ought to be.&nbsp; Look, it is too fine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus does a wise peasantry console itself under adverse physical
circumstances, and, by a startling democratic process, the defects of
the majority decide the type of beauty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is monsieur?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The master of the house is upstairs,&rsquo; she answered,
&lsquo;making you a goad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Blessed be the man who invented goads!&nbsp; Blessed the innkeeper
of Bouchet St. Nicolas, who introduced me to their use!&nbsp; This plain
wand, with an eighth of an inch of pin, was indeed a sceptre when he
put it in my hands.&nbsp; Thenceforward Modestine was my slave.&nbsp;
A prick, and she passed the most inviting stable door.&nbsp; A prick,
and she broke forth into a gallant little trotlet that devoured the
miles.&nbsp; It was not a remarkable speed, when all was said; and we
took four hours to cover ten miles at the best of it.&nbsp; But what
a heavenly change since yesterday!&nbsp; No more wielding of the ugly
cudgel; no more flailing with an aching arm; no more broadsword exercise,
but a discreet and gentlemanly fence.&nbsp; And what although now and
then a drop of blood should appear on Modestine&rsquo;s mouse-coloured
wedge-like rump?&nbsp; I should have preferred it otherwise, indeed;
but yesterday&rsquo;s exploits had purged my heart of all humanity.&nbsp;
The perverse little devil, since she would not be taken with kindness,
must even go with pricking.</p>
<p>It was bleak and bitter cold, and, except a cavalcade of stride-legged
ladies and a pair of post-runners, the road was dead solitary all the
way to Pradelles.&nbsp; I scarce remember an incident but one.&nbsp;
A handsome foal with a bell about his neck came charging up to us upon
a stretch of common, sniffed the air martially as one about to do great
deeds, and suddenly thinking otherwise in his green young heart, put
about and galloped off as he had come, the bell tinkling in the wind.&nbsp;
For a long while afterwards I saw his noble attitude as he drew up,
and heard the note of his bell; and when I struck the high-road, the
song of the telegraph-wires seemed to continue the same music.</p>
<p>Pradelles stands on a hillside, high above the Allier, surrounded
by rich meadows.&nbsp; They were cutting aftermath on all sides, which
gave the neighbourhood, this gusty autumn morning, an untimely smell
of hay.&nbsp; On the opposite bank of the Allier the land kept mounting
for miles to the horizon: a tanned and sallow autumn landscape, with
black blots of fir-wood and white roads wandering through the hills.&nbsp;
Over all this the clouds shed a uniform and purplish shadow, sad and
somewhat menacing, exaggerating height and distance, and throwing into
still higher relief the twisted ribbons of the highway.&nbsp; It was
a cheerless prospect, but one stimulating to a traveller.&nbsp; For
I was now upon the limit of Velay, and all that I beheld lay in another
county&mdash;wild G&eacute;vaudan, mountainous, uncultivated, and but
recently disforested from terror of the wolves.</p>
<p>Wolves, alas, like bandits, seem to flee the traveller&rsquo;s advance;
and you may trudge through all our comfortable Europe, and not meet
with an adventure worth the name.&nbsp; But here, if anywhere, a man
was on the frontiers of hope.&nbsp; For this was the land of the ever-memorable
BEAST, the Napoleon Bonaparte of wolves.&nbsp; What a career was his!&nbsp;
He lived ten months at free quarters in G&eacute;vaudan and Vivarais;
he ate women and children and &lsquo;shepherdesses celebrated for their
beauty&rsquo;; he pursued armed horsemen; he has been seen at broad
noonday chasing a post-chaise and outrider along the king&rsquo;s high-road,
and chaise and outrider fleeing before him at the gallop.&nbsp; He was
placarded like a political offender, and ten thousand francs were offered
for his head.&nbsp; And yet, when he was shot and sent to Versailles,
behold! a common wolf, and even small for that.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though
I could reach from pole to pole,&rsquo; sang Alexander Pope; the Little
Corporal shook Europe; and if all wolves had been as this wolf, they
would have changed the history of man.&nbsp; M. &Eacute;lie Berthet
has made him the hero of a novel, which I have read, and do not wish
to read again.</p>
<p>I hurried over my lunch, and was proof against the landlady&rsquo;s
desire that I should visit our Lady of Pradelles, &lsquo;who performed
many miracles, although she was of wood&rsquo;; and before three-quarters
of an hour I was goading Modestine down the steep descent that leads
to Langogne on the Allier.&nbsp; On both sides of the road, in big dusty
fields, farmers were preparing for next spring.&nbsp; Every fifty yards
a yoke of great-necked stolid oxen were patiently haling at the plough.&nbsp;
I saw one of these mild formidable servants of the glebe, who took a
sudden interest in Modestine and me.&nbsp; The furrow down which he
was journeying lay at an angle to the road, and his head was solidly
fixed to the yoke like those of caryatides below a ponderous cornice;
but he screwed round his big honest eyes and followed us with a ruminating
look, until his master bade him turn the plough and proceed to reascend
the field.&nbsp; From all these furrowing ploughshares, from the feet
of oxen, from a labourer here and there who was breaking the dry clods
with a hoe, the wind carried away a thin dust like so much smoke.&nbsp;
It was a fine, busy, breathing, rustic landscape; and as I continued
to descend, the highlands of G&eacute;vaudan kept mounting in front
of me against the sky.</p>
<p>I had crossed the Loire the day before; now I was to cross the Allier;
so near are these two confluents in their youth.&nbsp; Just at the bridge
of Langogne, as the long-promised rain was beginning to fall, a lassie
of some seven or eight addressed me in the sacramental phrase, &lsquo;<i>D&rsquo;o&ugrave;&rsquo;st-ce-que
vous venez</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; She did it with so high an air that she
set me laughing; and this cut her to the quick.&nbsp; She was evidently
one who reckoned on respect, and stood looking after me in silent dudgeon,
as I crossed the bridge and entered the county of G&eacute;vaudan.</p>
<h2>UPPER G&Eacute;VAUDAN</h2>
<blockquote><p>The way also here was very wearisome through dirt and
slabbiness; nor was there on all this ground so much as one inn or victualling-house
wherein to refresh the feebler sort.</p>
<p>PILGRIM&rsquo;S PROGRESS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>A CAMP IN THE DARK</h3>
<p>The next day (Tuesday, September 24th), it was two o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon before I got my journal written up and my knapsack
repaired, for I was determined to carry my knapsack in the future and
have no more ado with baskets; and half an hour afterwards I set out
for Le Cheylard l&rsquo;&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, a place on the borders
of the forest of Mercoire.&nbsp; A man, I was told, should walk there
in an hour and a half; and I thought it scarce too ambitious to suppose
that a man encumbered with a donkey might cover the same distance in
four hours.</p>
<p>All the way up the long hill from Langogne it rained and hailed alternately;
the wind kept freshening steadily, although slowly; plentiful hurrying
clouds&mdash;some dragging veils of straight rain-shower, others massed
and luminous as though promising snow&mdash;careered out of the north
and followed me along my way.&nbsp; I was soon out of the cultivated
basin of the Allier, and away from the ploughing oxen, and such-like
sights of the country.&nbsp; Moor, heathery marsh, tracts of rock and
pines, woods of birch all jewelled with the autumn yellow, here and
there a few naked cottages and bleak fields,&mdash;these were the characters
of the country.&nbsp; Hill and valley followed valley and hill; the
little green and stony cattle-tracks wandered in and out of one another,
split into three or four, died away in marshy hollows, and began again
sporadically on hillsides or at the borders of a wood.</p>
<p>There was no direct road to Cheylard, and it was no easy affair to
make a passage in this uneven country and through this intermittent
labyrinth of tracks.&nbsp; It must have been about four when I struck
Sagnerousse, and went on my way rejoicing in a sure point of departure.&nbsp;
Two hours afterwards, the dusk rapidly falling, in a lull of the wind,
I issued from a fir-wood where I had long been wandering, and found,
not the looked-for village, but another marish bottom among rough-and-tumble
hills.&nbsp; For some time past I had heard the ringing of cattle-bells
ahead; and now, as I came out of the skirts of the wood, I saw near
upon a dozen cows and perhaps as many more black figures, which I conjectured
to be children, although the mist had almost unrecognisably exaggerated
their forms.&nbsp; These were all silently following each other round
and round in a circle, now taking hands, now breaking up with chains
and reverences.&nbsp; A dance of children appeals to very innocent and
lively thoughts; but, at nightfall on the marshes, the thing was eerie
and fantastic to behold.&nbsp; Even I, who am well enough read in Herbert
Spencer, felt a sort of silence fall for an instant on my mind.&nbsp;
The next, I was pricking Modestine forward, and guiding her like an
unruly ship through the open.&nbsp; In a path, she went doggedly ahead
of her own accord, as before a fair wind; but once on the turf or among
heather, and the brute became demented.&nbsp; The tendency of lost travellers
to go round in a circle was developed in her to the degree of passion,
and it took all the steering I had in me to keep even a decently straight
course through a single field.</p>
<p>While I was thus desperately tacking through the bog, children and
cattle began to disperse, until only a pair of girls remained behind.&nbsp;
From these I sought direction on my path.&nbsp; The peasantry in general
were but little disposed to counsel a wayfarer.&nbsp; One old devil
simply retired into his house, and barricaded the door on my approach;
and I might beat and shout myself hoarse, he turned a deaf ear.&nbsp;
Another, having given me a direction which, as I found afterwards, I
had misunderstood, complacently watched me going wrong without adding
a sign.&nbsp; He did not care a stalk of parsley if I wandered all night
upon the hills!&nbsp; As for these two girls, they were a pair of impudent
sly sluts, with not a thought but mischief.&nbsp; One put out her tongue
at me, the other bade me follow the cows; and they both giggled and
jogged each other&rsquo;s elbows.&nbsp; The Beast of G&eacute;vaudan
ate about a hundred children of this district; I began to think of him
with sympathy.</p>
<p>Leaving the girls, I pushed on through the bog, and got into another
wood and upon a well-marked road.&nbsp; It grew darker and darker.&nbsp;
Modestine, suddenly beginning to smell mischief, bettered the pace of
her own accord, and from that time forward gave me no trouble.&nbsp;
It was the first sign of intelligence I had occasion to remark in her.&nbsp;
At the same time, the wind freshened into half a gale, and another heavy
discharge of rain came flying up out of the north.&nbsp; At the other
side of the wood I sighted some red windows in the dusk.&nbsp; This
was the hamlet of Fouzilhic; three houses on a hillside, near a wood
of birches.&nbsp; Here I found a delightful old man, who came a little
way with me in the rain to put me safely on the road for Cheylard.&nbsp;
He would hear of no reward; but shook his hands above his head almost
as if in menace, and refused volubly and shrilly, in unmitigated <i>patois.</i></p>
<p>All seemed right at last.&nbsp; My thoughts began to turn upon dinner
and a fireside, and my heart was agreeably softened in my bosom.&nbsp;
Alas, and I was on the brink of new and greater miseries!&nbsp; Suddenly,
at a single swoop, the night fell.&nbsp; I have been abroad in many
a black night, but never in a blacker.&nbsp; A glimmer of rocks, a glimmer
of the track where it was well beaten, a certain fleecy density, or
night within night, for a tree,&mdash;this was all that I could discriminate.&nbsp;
The sky was simply darkness overhead; even the flying clouds pursued
their way invisibly to human eyesight.&nbsp; I could not distinguish
my hand at arm&rsquo;s-length from the track, nor my goad, at the same
distance, from the meadows or the sky.</p>
<p>Soon the road that I was following split, after the fashion of the
country, into three or four in a piece of rocky meadow.&nbsp; Since
Modestine had shown such a fancy for beaten roads, I tried her instinct
in this predicament.&nbsp; But the instinct of an ass is what might
be expected from the name; in half a minute she was clambering round
and round among some boulders, as lost a donkey as you would wish to
see.&nbsp; I should have camped long before had I been properly provided;
but as this was to be so short a stage, I had brought no wine, no bread
for myself, and little over a pound for my lady friend.&nbsp; Add to
this, that I and Modestine were both handsomely wetted by the showers.&nbsp;
But now, if I could have found some water, I should have camped at once
in spite of all.&nbsp; Water, however, being entirely absent, except
in the form of rain, I determined to return to Fouzilhic, and ask a
guide a little farther on my way&mdash;&lsquo;a little farther lend
thy guiding hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The thing was easy to decide, hard to accomplish.&nbsp; In this sensible
roaring blackness I was sure of nothing but the direction of the wind.&nbsp;
To this I set my face; the road had disappeared, and I went across country,
now in marshy opens, now baffled by walls unscalable to Modestine, until
I came once more in sight of some red windows.&nbsp; This time they
were differently disposed.&nbsp; It was not Fouzilhic, but Fouzilhac,
a hamlet little distant from the other in space, but worlds away in
the spirit of its inhabitants.&nbsp; I tied Modestine to a gate, and
groped forward, stumbling among rocks, plunging mid-leg in bog, until
I gained the entrance of the village.&nbsp; In the first lighted house
there was a woman who would not open to me.&nbsp; She could do nothing,
she cried to me through the door, being alone and lame; but if I would
apply at the next house, there was a man who could help me if he had
a mind.</p>
<p>They came to the next door in force, a man, two women, and a girl,
and brought a pair of lanterns to examine the wayfarer.&nbsp; The man
was not ill-looking, but had a shifty smile.&nbsp; He leaned against
the doorpost, and heard me state my case.&nbsp; All I asked was a guide
as far as Cheylard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est que, voyez-vous, il fait noir</i>,&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>I told him that was just my reason for requiring help.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand that,&rsquo; said he, looking uncomfortable;
&lsquo;<i>mais&mdash;c&rsquo;est&mdash;de la peine</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was willing to pay, I said.&nbsp; He shook his head.&nbsp; I rose
as high as ten francs; but he continued to shake his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Name
your own price, then,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Ce n&rsquo;est pas &ccedil;a</i>,&rsquo; he said at length,
and with evident difficulty; &lsquo;but I am not going to cross the
door&mdash;<i>mais je ne sortirai pas de la porte</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I grew a little warm, and asked him what he proposed that I should
do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going beyond Cheylard?&rsquo; he asked by way
of answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is no affair of yours,&rsquo; I returned, for I was not
going to indulge his bestial curiosity; &lsquo;it changes nothing in
my present predicament.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est vrai, &ccedil;a</i>,&rsquo; he acknowledged,
with a laugh; &lsquo;<i>oui, c&rsquo;est vrai.&nbsp; Et d&rsquo;o&ugrave;
venez-vous</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A better man than I might have felt nettled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am not going to answer any of
your questions, so you may spare yourself the trouble of putting them.&nbsp;
I am late enough already; I want help.&nbsp; If you will not guide me
yourself, at least help me to find some one else who will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold on,&rsquo; he cried suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was it not
you who passed in the meadow while it was still day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said the girl, whom I had not hitherto recognised;
&lsquo;it was monsieur; I told him to follow the cow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for you, mademoiselle,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you are a
<i>farceuse</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; added the man, &lsquo;what the devil have you
done to be still here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>What the devil, indeed!&nbsp; But there I was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The great thing,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is to make an end of
it&rsquo;; and once more proposed that he should help me to find a guide.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est que</i>,&rsquo; he said again, &lsquo;<i>c&rsquo;est
que&mdash;il fait noir.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;take one of your lanterns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he cried, drawing a thought backward, and again
intrenching himself behind one of his former phrases; &lsquo;I will
not cross the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him.&nbsp; I saw unaffected terror struggling on his
face with unaffected shame; he was smiling pitifully and wetting his
lip with his tongue, like a detected schoolboy.&nbsp; I drew a brief
picture of my state, and asked him what I was to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I will not cross
the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here was the Beast of G&eacute;vaudan, and no mistake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said I, with my most commanding manners, &lsquo;you
are a coward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with that I turned my back upon the family party, who hastened
to retire within their fortifications; and the famous door was closed
again, but not till I had overheard the sound of laughter.&nbsp; <i>Filia
barbara pater barbarior</i>.&nbsp; Let me say it in the plural: the
Beasts of G&eacute;vaudan.</p>
<p>The lanterns had somewhat dazzled me, and I ploughed distressfully
among stones and rubbish-heaps.&nbsp; All the other houses in the village
were both dark and silent; and though I knocked at here and there a
door, my knocking was unanswered.&nbsp; It was a bad business; I gave
up Fouzilhac with my curses.&nbsp; The rain had stopped, and the wind,
which still kept rising, began to dry my coat and trousers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
well,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;water or no water, I must camp.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But the first thing was to return to Modestine.&nbsp; I am pretty sure
I was twenty minutes groping for my lady in the dark; and if it had
not been for the unkindly services of the bog, into which I once more
stumbled, I might have still been groping for her at the dawn.&nbsp;
My next business was to gain the shelter of a wood, for the wind was
cold as well as boisterous.&nbsp; How, in this well-wooded district,
I should have been so long in finding one, is another of the insoluble
mysteries of this day&rsquo;s adventures; but I will take my oath that
I put near an hour to the discovery.</p>
<p>At last black trees began to show upon my left, and, suddenly crossing
the road, made a cave of unmitigated blackness right in front.&nbsp;
I call it a cave without exaggeration; to pass below that arch of leaves
was like entering a dungeon.&nbsp; I felt about until my hand encountered
a stout branch, and to this I tied Modestine, a haggard, drenched, desponding
donkey.&nbsp; Then I lowered my pack, laid it along the wall on the
margin of the road, and unbuckled the straps.&nbsp; I knew well enough
where the lantern was; but where were the candles?&nbsp; I groped and
groped among the tumbled articles, and, while I was thus groping, suddenly
I touched the spirit-lamp.&nbsp; Salvation!&nbsp; This would serve my
turn as well.&nbsp; The wind roared unwearyingly among the trees; I
could hear the boughs tossing and the leaves churning through half a
mile of forest; yet the scene of my encampment was not only as black
as the pit, but admirably sheltered.&nbsp; At the second match the wick
caught flame.&nbsp; The light was both livid and shifting; but it cut
me off from the universe, and doubled the darkness of the surrounding
night.</p>
<p>I tied Modestine more conveniently for herself, and broke up half
the black bread for her supper, reserving the other half against the
morning.&nbsp; Then I gathered what I should want within reach, took
off my wet boots and gaiters, which I wrapped in my waterproof, arranged
my knapsack for a pillow under the flap of my sleeping-bag, insinuated
my limbs into the interior, and buckled myself in like a bambino.&nbsp;
I opened a tin of Bologna sausage and broke a cake of chocolate, and
that was all I had to eat.&nbsp; It may sound offensive, but I ate them
together, bite by bite, by way of bread and meat.&nbsp; All I had to
wash down this revolting mixture was neat brandy: a revolting beverage
in itself.&nbsp; But I was rare and hungry; ate well, and smoked one
of the best cigarettes in my experience.&nbsp; Then I put a stone in
my straw hat, pulled the flap of my fur cap over my neck and eyes, put
my revolver ready to my hand, and snuggled well down among the sheepskins.</p>
<p>I questioned at first if I were sleepy, for I felt my heart beating
faster than usual, as if with an agreeable excitement to which my mind
remained a stranger.&nbsp; But as soon as my eyelids touched, that subtle
glue leaped between them, and they would no more come separate.&nbsp;
The wind among the trees was my lullaby.&nbsp; Sometimes it sounded
for minutes together with a steady, even rush, not rising nor abating;
and again it would swell and burst like a great crashing breaker, and
the trees would patter me all over with big drops from the rain of the
afternoon.&nbsp; Night after night, in my own bedroom in the country,
I have given ear to this perturbing concert of the wind among the woods;
but whether it was a difference in the trees, or the lie of the ground,
or because I was myself outside and in the midst of it, the fact remains
that the wind sang to a different tune among these woods of G&eacute;vaudan.&nbsp;
I hearkened and hearkened; and meanwhile sleep took gradual possession
of my body and subdued my thoughts and senses; but still my last waking
effort was to listen and distinguish, and my last conscious state was
one of wonder at the foreign clamour in my ears.</p>
<p>Twice in the course of the dark hours&mdash;once when a stone galled
me underneath the sack, and again when the poor patient Modestine, growing
angry, pawed and stamped upon the road&mdash;I was recalled for a brief
while to consciousness, and saw a star or two overhead, and the lace-like
edge of the foliage against the sky.&nbsp; When I awoke for the third
time (Wednesday, September 25th), the world was flooded with a blue
light, the mother of the dawn.&nbsp; I saw the leaves labouring in the
wind and the ribbon of the road; and, on turning my head, there was
Modestine tied to a beech, and standing half across the path in an attitude
of inimitable patience.&nbsp; I closed my eyes again, and set to thinking
over the experience of the night.&nbsp; I was surprised to find how
easy and pleasant it had been, even in this tempestuous weather.&nbsp;
The stone which annoyed me would not have been there, had I not been
forced to camp blindfold in the opaque night; and I had felt no other
inconvenience, except when my feet encountered the lantern or the second
volume of Peyrat&rsquo;s <i>Pastors of the Desert</i> among the mixed
contents of my sleeping-bag; nay, more, I had felt not a touch of cold,
and awakened with unusually lightsome and clear sensations.</p>
<p>With that, I shook myself, got once more into my boots and gaiters,
and, breaking up the rest of the bread for Modestine, strolled about
to see in what part of the world I had awakened.&nbsp; Ulysses, left
on Ithaca, and with a mind unsettled by the goddess, was not more pleasantly
astray.&nbsp; I have been after an adventure all my life, a pure dispassionate
adventure, such as befell early and heroic voyagers; and thus to be
found by morning in a random woodside nook in G&eacute;vaudan&mdash;not
knowing north from south, as strange to my surroundings as the first
man upon the earth, an inland castaway&mdash;was to find a fraction
of my day-dreams realised.&nbsp; I was on the skirts of a little wood
of birch, sprinkled with a few beeches; behind, it adjoined another
wood of fir; and in front, it broke up and went down in open order into
a shallow and meadowy dale.&nbsp; All around there were bare hilltops,
some near, some far away, as the perspective closed or opened, but none
apparently much higher than the rest.&nbsp; The wind huddled the trees.&nbsp;
The golden specks of autumn in the birches tossed shiveringly.&nbsp;
Overhead the sky was full of strings and shreds of vapour, flying, vanishing,
reappearing, and turning about an axis like tumblers, as the wind hounded
them through heaven.&nbsp; It was wild weather and famishing cold.&nbsp;
I ate some chocolate, swallowed a mouthful of brandy, and smoked a cigarette
before the cold should have time to disable my fingers.&nbsp; And by
the time I had got all this done, and had made my pack and bound it
on the pack-saddle, the day was tiptoe on the threshold of the east.&nbsp;
We had not gone many steps along the lane, before the sun, still invisible
to me, sent a glow of gold over some cloud mountains that lay ranged
along the eastern sky.</p>
<p>The wind had us on the stern, and hurried us bitingly forward.&nbsp;
I buttoned myself into my coat, and walked on in a pleasant frame of
mind with all men, when suddenly, at a corner, there was Fouzilhic once
more in front of me.&nbsp; Nor only that, but there was the old gentleman
who had escorted me so far the night before, running out of his house
at sight of me, with hands upraised in horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor boy!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;what does this mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I told him what had happened.&nbsp; He beat his old hands like clappers
in a mill, to think how lightly he had let me go; but when he heard
of the man of Fouzilhac, anger and depression seized upon his mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This time, at least,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;there shall be
no mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he limped along, for he was very rheumatic, for about half a
mile, and until I was almost within sight of Cheylard, the destination
I had hunted for so long.</p>
<h3>CHEYLARD AND LUC</h3>
<p>Candidly, it seemed little worthy of all this searching.&nbsp; A
few broken ends of village, with no particular street, but a succession
of open places heaped with logs and fagots; a couple of tilted crosses,
a shrine to Our Lady of all Graces on the summit of a little hill; and
all this, upon a rattling highland river, in the corner of a naked valley.&nbsp;
What went ye out for to see? thought I to myself.&nbsp; But the place
had a life of its own.&nbsp; I found a board, commemorating the liberalities
of Cheylard for the past year, hung up, like a banner, in the diminutive
and tottering church.&nbsp; In 1877, it appeared, the inhabitants subscribed
forty-eight francs ten centimes for the &lsquo;Work of the Propagation
of the Faith.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some of this, I could not help hoping, would
be applied to my native land.&nbsp; Cheylard scrapes together halfpence
for the darkened souls in Edinburgh; while Balquhidder and Dunrossness
bemoan the ignorance of Rome.&nbsp; Thus, to the high entertainment
of the angels, do we pelt each other with evangelists, like schoolboys
bickering in the snow.</p>
<p>The inn was again singularly unpretentious.&nbsp; The whole furniture
of a not ill-to-do family was in the kitchen: the beds, the cradle,
the clothes, the plate-rack, the meal-chest, and the photograph of the
parish priest.&nbsp; There were five children, one of whom was set to
its morning prayers at the stair-foot soon after my arrival, and a sixth
would ere long be forthcoming.&nbsp; I was kindly received by these
good folk.&nbsp; They were much interested in my misadventure.&nbsp;
The wood in which I had slept belonged to them; the man of Fouzilhac
they thought a monster of iniquity, and counselled me warmly to summon
him at law&mdash;&lsquo;because I might have died.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
good wife was horror-stricken to see me drink over a pint of uncreamed
milk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will do yourself an evil,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Permit
me to boil it for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After I had begun the morning on this delightful liquor, she having
an infinity of things to arrange, I was permitted, nay requested, to
make a bowl of chocolate for myself.&nbsp; My boots and gaiters were
hung up to dry, and, seeing me trying to write my journal on my knee,
the eldest daughter let down a hinged table in the chimney-corner for
my convenience.&nbsp; Here I wrote, drank my chocolate, and finally
ate an omelette before I left.&nbsp; The table was thick with dust;
for, as they explained, it was not used except in winter weather.&nbsp;
I had a clear look up the vent, through brown agglomerations of soot
and blue vapour, to the sky; and whenever a handful of twigs was thrown
on to the fire, my legs were scorched by the blaze.</p>
<p>The husband had begun life as a muleteer, and when I came to charge
Modestine showed himself full of the prudence of his art.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
will have to change this package,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;it ought to
be in two parts, and then you might have double the weight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I explained that I wanted no more weight; and for no donkey hitherto
created would I cut my sleeping-bag in two.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It fatigues her, however,&rsquo; said the innkeeper; &lsquo;it
fatigues her greatly on the march.&nbsp; Look.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alas, there were her two forelegs no better than raw beef on the
inside, and blood was running from under her tail.&nbsp; They told me
when I started, and I was ready to believe it, that before a few days
I should come to love Modestine like a dog.&nbsp; Three days had passed,
we had shared some misadventures, and my heart was still as cold as
a potato towards my beast of burden.&nbsp; She was pretty enough to
look at; but then she had given proof of dead stupidity, redeemed indeed
by patience, but aggravated by flashes of sorry and ill-judged light-heartedness.&nbsp;
And I own this new discovery seemed another point against her.&nbsp;
What the devil was the good of a she-ass if she could not carry a sleeping-bag
and a few necessaries?&nbsp; I saw the end of the fable rapidly approaching,
when I should have to carry Modestine.&nbsp; &AElig;sop was the man
to know the world!&nbsp; I assure you I set out with heavy thoughts
upon my short day&rsquo;s march.</p>
<p>It was not only heavy thoughts about Modestine that weighted me upon
the way; it was a leaden business altogether.&nbsp; For first, the wind
blew so rudely that I had to hold on the pack with one hand from Cheylard
to Luc; and second, my road lay through one of the most beggarly countries
in the world.&nbsp; It was like the worst of the Scottish Highlands,
only worse; cold, naked, and ignoble, scant of wood, scant of heather,
scant of life.&nbsp; A road and some fences broke the unvarying waste,
and the line of the road was marked by upright pillars, to serve in
time of snow.</p>
<p>Why any one should desire to visit either Luc or Cheylard is more
than my much-inventing spirit can suppose.&nbsp; For my part, I travel
not to go anywhere, but to go.&nbsp; I travel for travel&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;
The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life
more nearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilisation, and
find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.&nbsp;
Alas, as we get up in life, and are more preoccupied with our affairs,
even a holiday is a thing that must be worked for.&nbsp; To hold a pack
upon a pack-saddle against a gale out of the freezing north is no high
industry, but it is one that serves to occupy and compose the mind.&nbsp;
And when the present is so exacting, who can annoy himself about the
future?</p>
<p>I came out at length above the Allier.&nbsp; A more unsightly prospect
at this season of the year it would be hard to fancy.&nbsp; Shelving
hills rose round it on all sides, here dabbled with wood and fields,
there rising to peaks alternately naked and hairy with pines.&nbsp;
The colour throughout was black or ashen, and came to a point in the
ruins of the castle of Luc, which pricked up impudently from below my
feet, carrying on a pinnacle a tall white statue of Our Lady, which,
I heard with interest, weighed fifty quintals, and was to be dedicated
on the 6th of October.&nbsp; Through this sorry landscape trickled the
Allier and a tributary of nearly equal size, which came down to join
it through a broad nude valley in Vivarais.&nbsp; The weather had somewhat
lightened, and the clouds massed in squadron; but the fierce wind still
hunted them through heaven, and cast great ungainly splashes of shadow
and sunlight over the scene.</p>
<p>Luc itself was a straggling double file of houses wedged between
hill and river.&nbsp; It had no beauty, nor was there any notable feature,
save the old castle overhead with its fifty quintals of brand-new Madonna.&nbsp;
But the inn was clean and large.&nbsp; The kitchen, with its two box-beds
hung with clean check curtains, with its wide stone chimney, its chimney-shelf
four yards long and garnished with lanterns and religious statuettes,
its array of chests and pair of ticking clocks, was the very model of
what a kitchen ought to be; a melodrama kitchen, suitable for bandits
or noblemen in disguise.&nbsp; Nor was the scene disgraced by the landlady,
a handsome, silent, dark old woman, clothed and hooded in black like
a nun.&nbsp; Even the public bedroom had a character of its own, with
the long deal tables and benches, where fifty might have dined, set
out as for a harvest-home, and the three box-beds along the wall.&nbsp;
In one of these, lying on straw and covered with a pair of table-napkins,
did I do penance all night long in goose-flesh and chattering teeth,
and sigh, from time to time as I awakened, for my sheepskin sack and
the lee of some great wood.</p>
<h2>OUR LADY OF THE SNOWS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I behold<br />

And what am I, that I am here?&rsquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>FATHER APOLLINARIS</h3>
<p>Next morning (Thursday, 26th September) I took the road in a new
order.&nbsp; The sack was no longer doubled, but hung at full length
across the saddle, a green sausage six feet long with a tuft of blue
wool hanging out of either end.&nbsp; It was more picturesque, it spared
the donkey, and, as I began to see, it would ensure stability, blow
high, blow low.&nbsp; But it was not without a pang that I had so decided.&nbsp;
For although I had purchased a new cord, and made all as fast as I was
able, I was yet jealously uneasy lest the flaps should tumble out and
scatter my effects along the line of march.</p>
<p>My way lay up the bald valley of the river, along the march of Vivarais
and G&eacute;vaudan.&nbsp; The hills of G&eacute;vaudan on the right
were a little more naked, if anything, than those of Vivarais upon the
left, and the former had a monopoly of a low dotty underwood that grew
thickly in the gorges and died out in solitary burrs upon the shoulders
and the summits.&nbsp; Black bricks of fir-wood were plastered here
and there upon both sides, and here and there were cultivated fields.&nbsp;
A railway ran beside the river; the only bit of railway in G&eacute;vaudan,
although there are many proposals afoot and surveys being made, and
even, as they tell me, a station standing ready built in Mende.&nbsp;
A year or two hence and this may be another world.&nbsp; The desert
is beleaguered.&nbsp; Now may some Languedocian Wordsworth turn the
sonnet into <i>patois</i>: &lsquo;Mountains and vales and floods, heard
YE that whistle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At a place called La Bastide I was directed to leave the river, and
follow a road that mounted on the left among the hills of Vivarais,
the modern Ard&egrave;che; for I was now come within a little way of
my strange destination, the Trappist monastery of Our Lady of the Snows.&nbsp;
The sun came out as I left the shelter of a pine-wood, and I beheld
suddenly a fine wild landscape to the south.&nbsp; High rocky hills,
as blue as sapphire, closed the view, and between these lay ridge upon
ridge, heathery, craggy, the sun glittering on veins of rock, the underwood
clambering in the hollows, as rude as God made them at the first.&nbsp;
There was not a sign of man&rsquo;s hand in all the prospect; and indeed
not a trace of his passage, save where generation after generation had
walked in twisted footpaths, in and out among the beeches, and up and
down upon the channelled slopes.&nbsp; The mists, which had hitherto
beset me, were now broken into clouds, and fled swiftly and shone brightly
in the sun.&nbsp; I drew a long breath.&nbsp; It was grateful to come,
after so long, upon a scene of some attraction for the human heart.&nbsp;
I own I like definite form in what my eyes are to rest upon; and if
landscapes were sold, like the sheets of characters of my boyhood, one
penny plain and twopence coloured, I should go the length of twopence
every day of my life.</p>
<p>But if things had grown better to the south, it was still desolate
and inclement near at hand.&nbsp; A spidery cross on every hill-top
marked the neighbourhood of a religious house; and a quarter of a mile
beyond, the outlook southward opening out and growing bolder with every
step, a white statue of the Virgin at the corner of a young plantation
directed the traveller to Our Lady of the Snows.&nbsp; Here, then, I
struck leftward, and pursued my way, driving my secular donkey before
me, and creaking in my secular boots and gaiters, towards the asylum
of silence.</p>
<p>I had not gone very far ere the wind brought to me the clanging of
a bell, and somehow, I can scarce tell why, my heart sank within me
at the sound.&nbsp; I have rarely approached anything with more unaffected
terror than the monastery of Our Lady of the Snows.&nbsp; This it is
to have had a Protestant education.&nbsp; And suddenly, on turning a
corner, fear took hold on me from head to foot&mdash;slavish, superstitious
fear; and though I did not stop in my advance, yet I went on slowly,
like a man who should have passed a bourne unnoticed, and strayed into
the country of the dead.&nbsp; For there, upon the narrow new-made road,
between the stripling pines, was a mediaeval friar, fighting with a
barrowful of turfs.&nbsp; Every Sunday of my childhood I used to study
the Hermits of Marco Sadeler&mdash;enchanting prints, full of wood and
field and mediaeval landscapes, as large as a county, for the imagination
to go a-travelling in; and here, sure enough, was one of Marco Sadeler&rsquo;s
heroes.&nbsp; He was robed in white like any spectre, and the hood falling
back, in the instancy of his contention with the barrow, disclosed a
pate as bald and yellow as a skull.&nbsp; He might have been buried
any time these thousand years, and all the lively parts of him resolved
into earth and broken up with the farmer&rsquo;s harrow.</p>
<p>I was troubled besides in my mind as to etiquette.&nbsp; Durst I
address a person who was under a vow of silence?&nbsp; Clearly not.&nbsp;
But drawing near, I doffed my cap to him with a far-away superstitious
reverence.&nbsp; He nodded back, and cheerfully addressed me.&nbsp;
Was I going to the monastery?&nbsp; Who was I?&nbsp; An Englishman?&nbsp;
Ah, an Irishman, then?</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;a Scotsman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Scotsman?&nbsp; Ah, he had never seen a Scotsman before.&nbsp;
And he looked me all over, his good, honest, brawny countenance shining
with interest, as a boy might look upon a lion or an alligator.&nbsp;
From him I learned with disgust that I could not be received at Our
Lady of the Snows; I might get a meal, perhaps, but that was all.&nbsp;
And then, as our talk ran on, and it turned out that I was not a pedlar,
but a literary man, who drew landscapes and was going to write a book,
he changed his manner of thinking as to my reception (for I fear they
respect persons even in a Trappist monastery), and told me I must be
sure to ask for the Father Prior, and state my case to him in full.&nbsp;
On second thoughts he determined to go down with me himself; he thought
he could manage for me better.&nbsp; Might he say that I was a geographer?</p>
<p>No; I thought, in the interests of truth, he positively might not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then&rsquo; (with disappointment), &lsquo;an author.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It appeared he had been in a seminary with six young Irishmen, all
priests long since, who had received newspapers and kept him informed
of the state of ecclesiastical affairs in England.&nbsp; And he asked
me eagerly after Dr. Pusey, for whose conversion the good man had continued
ever since to pray night and morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought he was very near the truth,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and
he will reach it yet; there is so much virtue in prayer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He must be a stiff, ungodly Protestant who can take anything but
pleasure in this kind and hopeful story.&nbsp; While he was thus near
the subject, the good father asked me if I were a Christian; and when
he found I was not, or not after his way, he glossed it over with great
good-will.</p>
<p>The road which we were following, and which this stalwart father
had made with his own two hands within the space of a year, came to
a corner, and showed us some white buildings a little farther on beyond
the wood.&nbsp; At the same time, the bell once more sounded abroad.&nbsp;
We were hard upon the monastery.&nbsp; Father Apollinaris (for that
was my companion&rsquo;s name) stopped me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must not speak to you down there,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ask for the Brother Porter, and all will be well.&nbsp; But try
to see me as you go out again through the wood, where I may speak to
you.&nbsp; I am charmed to have made your acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then suddenly raising his arms, flapping his fingers, and crying
out twice, &lsquo;I must not speak, I must not speak!&rsquo; he ran
away in front of me, and disappeared into the monastery door.</p>
<p>I own this somewhat ghastly eccentricity went a good way to revive
my terrors.&nbsp; But where one was so good and simple, why should not
all be alike?&nbsp; I took heart of grace, and went forward to the gate
as fast as Modestine, who seemed to have a disaffection for monasteries,
would permit.&nbsp; It was the first door, in my acquaintance of her,
which she had not shown an indecent haste to enter.&nbsp; I summoned
the place in form, though with a quaking heart.&nbsp; Father Michael,
the Father Hospitaller, and a pair of brown-robed brothers came to the
gate and spoke with me a while.&nbsp; I think my sack was the great
attraction; it had already beguiled the heart of poor Apollinaris, who
had charged me on my life to show it to the Father Prior.&nbsp; But
whether it was my address, or the sack, or the idea speedily published
among that part of the brotherhood who attend on strangers that I was
not a pedlar after all, I found no difficulty as to my reception.&nbsp;
Modestine was led away by a layman to the stables, and I and my pack
were received into Our Lady of the Snows.</p>
<h3>THE MONKS</h3>
<p>Father Michael, a pleasant, fresh-faced, smiling man, perhaps of
thirty-five, took me to the pantry, and gave me a glass of liqueur to
stay me until dinner.&nbsp; We had some talk, or rather I should say
he listened to my prattle indulgently enough, but with an abstracted
air, like a spirit with a thing of clay.&nbsp; And truly, when I remember
that I descanted principally on my appetite, and that it must have been
by that time more than eighteen hours since Father Michael had so much
as broken bread, I can well understand that he would find an earthly
savour in my conversation.&nbsp; But his manner, though superior, was
exquisitely gracious; and I find I have a lurking curiosity as to Father
Michael&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>The whet administered, I was left alone for a little in the monastery
garden.&nbsp; This is no more than the main court, laid out in sandy
paths and beds of parti-coloured dahlias, and with a fountain and a
black statue of the Virgin in the centre.&nbsp; The buildings stand
around it four-square, bleak, as yet unseasoned by the years and weather,
and with no other features than a belfry and a pair of slated gables.&nbsp;
Brothers in white, brothers in brown, passed silently along the sanded
alleys; and when I first came out, three hooded monks were kneeling
on the terrace at their prayers.&nbsp; A naked hill commands the monastery
upon one side, and the wood commands it on the other.&nbsp; It lies
exposed to wind; the snow falls off and on from October to May, and
sometimes lies six weeks on end; but if they stood in Eden, with a climate
like heaven&rsquo;s, the buildings themselves would offer the same wintry
and cheerless aspect; and for my part, on this wild September day, before
I was called to dinner, I felt chilly in and out.</p>
<p>When I had eaten well and heartily, Brother Ambrose, a hearty conversible
Frenchman (for all those who wait on strangers have the liberty to speak),
led me to a little room in that part of the building which is set apart
for <i>MM. les retraitants</i>.&nbsp; It was clean and whitewashed,
and furnished with strict necessaries, a crucifix, a bust of the late
Pope, the <i>Imitation</i> in French, a book of religious meditations,
and the <i>Life of Elizabeth Seton</i>, evangelist, it would appear,
of North America and of New England in particular.&nbsp; As far as my
experience goes, there is a fair field for some more evangelisation
in these quarters; but think of Cotton Mather!&nbsp; I should like to
give him a reading of this little work in heaven, where I hope he dwells;
but perhaps he knows all that already, and much more; and perhaps he
and Mrs. Seton are the dearest friends, and gladly unite their voices
in the everlasting psalm.&nbsp; Over the table, to conclude the inventory
of the room, hung a set of regulations for <i>MM. les retraitants</i>:
what services they should attend, when they were to tell their beads
or meditate, and when they were to rise and go to rest.&nbsp; At the
foot was a notable N.B.: &lsquo;<i>Le temps libre est employ&eacute;
&agrave; l&rsquo;examen de conscience, &agrave; la confession, &agrave;
faire de bonnes r&eacute;solutions, etc</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; To make good
resolutions, indeed!&nbsp; You might talk as fruitfully of making the
hair grow on your head.</p>
<p>I had scarce explored my niche when Brother Ambrose returned.&nbsp;
An English boarder, it appeared, would like to speak with me.&nbsp;
I professed my willingness, and the friar ushered in a fresh, young,
little Irishman of fifty, a deacon of the Church, arrayed in strict
canonicals, and wearing on his head what, in default of knowledge, I
can only call the ecclesiastical shako.&nbsp; He had lived seven years
in retreat at a convent of nuns in Belgium, and now five at Our Lady
of the Snows; he never saw an English newspaper; he spoke French imperfectly,
and had he spoken it like a native, there was not much chance of conversation
where he dwelt.&nbsp; With this, he was a man eminently sociable, greedy
of news, and simple-minded like a child.&nbsp; If I was pleased to have
a guide about the monastery, he was no less delighted to see an English
face and hear an English tongue.</p>
<p>He showed me his own room, where he passed his time among breviaries,
Hebrew Bibles, and the Waverley Novels.&nbsp; Thence he led me to the
cloisters, into the chapter-house, through the vestry, where the brothers&rsquo;
gowns and broad straw hats were hanging up, each with his religious
name upon a board&mdash;names full of legendary suavity and interest,
such as Basil, Hilarion, Raphael, or Pacifique; into the library, where
were all the works of Veuillot and Chateaubriand, and the <i>Odes et</i>
<i>Ballades</i>, if you please, and even Moli&egrave;re, to say nothing
of innumerable fathers and a great variety of local and general historians.&nbsp;
Thence my good Irishman took me round the workshops, where brothers
bake bread, and make cartwheels, and take photographs; where one superintends
a collection of curiosities, and another a gallery of rabbits.&nbsp;
For in a Trappist monastery each monk has an occupation of his own choice,
apart from his religious duties and the general labours of the house.&nbsp;
Each must sing in the choir, if he has a voice and ear, and join in
the haymaking if he has a hand to stir; but in his private hours, although
he must be occupied, he may be occupied on what he likes.&nbsp; Thus
I was told that one brother was engaged with literature; while Father
Apollinaris busies himself in making roads, and the Abbot employs himself
in binding books.&nbsp; It is not so long since this Abbot was consecrated,
by the way; and on that occasion, by a special grace, his mother was
permitted to enter the chapel and witness the ceremony of consecration.&nbsp;
A proud day for her to have a son a mitred abbot; it makes you glad
to think they let her in.</p>
<p>In all these journeyings to and fro, many silent fathers and brethren
fell in our way.&nbsp; Usually they paid no more regard to our passage
than if we had been a cloud; but sometimes the good deacon had a permission
to ask of them, and it was granted by a peculiar movement of the hands,
almost like that of a dog&rsquo;s paws in swimming, or refused by the
usual negative signs, and in either case with lowered eyelids and a
certain air of contrition, as of a man who was steering very close to
evil.</p>
<p>The monks, by special grace of their Abbot, were still taking two
meals a day; but it was already time for their grand fast, which begins
somewhere in September and lasts till Easter, and during which they
eat but once in the twenty-four hours, and that at two in the afternoon,
twelve hours after they have begun the toil and vigil of the day.&nbsp;
Their meals are scanty, but even of these they eat sparingly; and though
each is allowed a small carafe of wine, many refrain from this indulgence.&nbsp;
Without doubt, the most of mankind grossly overeat themselves; our meals
serve not only for support, but as a hearty and natural diversion from
the labour of life.&nbsp; Yet, though excess may be hurtful, I should
have thought this Trappist regimen defective.&nbsp; And I am astonished,
as I look back, at the freshness of face and cheerfulness of manner
of all whom I beheld.&nbsp; A happier nor a healthier company I should
scarce suppose that I have ever seen.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, on
this bleak upland, and with the incessant occupation of the monks, life
is of an uncertain tenure, and death no infrequent visitor, at Our Lady
of the Snows.&nbsp; This, at least, was what was told me.&nbsp; But
if they die easily, they must live healthily in the meantime, for they
seemed all firm of flesh and high in colour; and the only morbid sign
that I could observe, an unusual brilliancy of eye, was one that served
rather to increase the general impression of vivacity and strength.</p>
<p>Those with whom I spoke were singularly sweet-tempered, with what
I can only call a holy cheerfulness in air and conversation.&nbsp; There
is a note, in the direction to visitors, telling them not to be offended
at the curt speech of those who wait upon them, since it is proper to
monks to speak little.&nbsp; The note might have been spared; to a man
the hospitallers were all brimming with innocent talk, and, in my experience
of the monastery, it was easier to begin than to break off a conversation.&nbsp;
With the exception of Father Michael, who was a man of the world, they
showed themselves full of kind and healthy interest in all sorts of
subjects&mdash;in politics, in voyages, in my sleeping-sack&mdash;and
not without a certain pleasure in the sound of their own voices.</p>
<p>As for those who are restricted to silence, I can only wonder how
they bear their solemn and cheerless isolation.&nbsp; And yet, apart
from any view of mortification, I can see a certain policy, not only
in the exclusion of women, but in this vow of silence.&nbsp; I have
had some experience of lay phalansteries, of an artistic, not to say
a bacchanalian character; and seen more than one association easily
formed and yet more easily dispersed.&nbsp; With a Cistercian rule,
perhaps they might have lasted longer.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood of
women it is but a touch-and-go association that can be formed among
defenceless men; the stronger electricity is sure to triumph; the dreams
of boyhood, the schemes of youth, are abandoned after an interview of
ten minutes, and the arts and sciences, and professional male jollity,
deserted at once for two sweet eyes and a caressing accent.&nbsp; And
next after this, the tongue is the great divider.</p>
<p>I am almost ashamed to pursue this worldly criticism of a religious
rule; but there is yet another point in which the Trappist order appeals
to me as a model of wisdom.&nbsp; By two in the morning the clapper
goes upon the bell, and so on, hour by hour, and sometimes quarter by
quarter, till eight, the hour of rest; so infinitesimally is the day
divided among different occupations.&nbsp; The man who keeps rabbits,
for example, hurries from his hutches to the chapel, the chapter-room,
or the refectory, all day long: every hour he has an office to sing,
a duty to perform; from two, when he rises in the dark, till eight,
when he returns to receive the comfortable gift of sleep, he is upon
his feet and occupied with manifold and changing business.&nbsp; I know
many persons, worth several thousands in the year, who are not so fortunate
in the disposal of their lives.&nbsp; Into how many houses would not
the note of the monastery bell, dividing the day into manageable portions,
bring peace of mind and healthful activity of body!&nbsp; We speak of
hardships, but the true hardship is to be a dull fool, and permitted
to mismanage life in our own dull and foolish manner.</p>
<p>From this point of view, we may perhaps better understand the monk&rsquo;s
existence.&nbsp; A long novitiate and every proof of constancy of mind
and strength of body is required before admission to the order; but
I could not find that many were discouraged.&nbsp; In the photographer&rsquo;s
studio, which figures so strangely among the outbuildings, my eye was
attracted by the portrait of a young fellow in the uniform of a private
of foot.&nbsp; This was one of the novices, who came of the age for
service, and marched and drilled and mounted guard for the proper time
among the garrison of Algiers.&nbsp; Here was a man who had surely seen
both sides of life before deciding; yet as soon as he was set free from
service he returned to finish his novitiate.</p>
<p>This austere rule entitles a man to heaven as by right.&nbsp; When
the Trappist sickens, he quits not his habit; he lies in the bed of
death as he has prayed and laboured in his frugal and silent existence;
and when the Liberator comes, at the very moment, even before they have
carried him in his robe to lie his little last in the chapel among continual
chantings, joy-bells break forth, as if for a marriage, from the slated
belfry, and proclaim throughout the neighbourhood that another soul
has gone to God.</p>
<p>At night, under the conduct of my kind Irishman, I took my place
in the gallery to hear compline and <i>Salve Regina</i>, with which
the Cistercians bring every day to a conclusion.&nbsp; There were none
of those circumstances which strike the Protestant as childish or as
tawdry in the public offices of Rome.&nbsp; A stern simplicity, heightened
by the romance of the surroundings, spoke directly to the heart.&nbsp;
I recall the whitewashed chapel, the hooded figures in the choir, the
lights alternately occluded and revealed, the strong manly singing,
the silence that ensued, the sight of cowled heads bowed in prayer,
and then the clear trenchant beating of the bell, breaking in to show
that the last office was over and the hour of sleep had come; and when
I remember, I am not surprised that I made my escape into the court
with somewhat whirling fancies, and stood like a man bewildered in the
windy starry night.</p>
<p>But I was weary; and when I had quieted my spirits with Elizabeth
Seton&rsquo;s memoirs&mdash;a dull work&mdash;the cold and the raving
of the wind among the pines (for my room was on that side of the monastery
which adjoins the woods) disposed me readily to slumber.&nbsp; I was
wakened at black midnight, as it seemed, though it was really two in
the morning, by the first stroke upon the bell.&nbsp; All the brothers
were then hurrying to the chapel; the dead in life, at this untimely
hour, were already beginning the uncomforted labours of their day.&nbsp;
The dead in life&mdash;there was a chill reflection.&nbsp; And the words
of a French song came back into my memory, telling of the best of our
mixed existence:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Que t&rsquo;as de belles filles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girofl&eacute;!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girofla!<br />
Que t&rsquo;as de belles filles,<br />
L&rsquo;Amour let comptera!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I blessed God that I was free to wander, free to hope, and free
to love.</p>
<h3>THE BOARDERS</h3>
<p>But there was another side to my residence at Our Lady of the Snows.&nbsp;
At this late season there were not many boarders; and yet I was not
alone in the public part of the monastery.&nbsp; This itself is hard
by the gate, with a small dining-room on the ground-floor and a whole
corridor of cells similar to mine upstairs.&nbsp; I have stupidly forgotten
the board for a regular <i>retraitant</i>; but it was somewhere between
three and five francs a day, and I think most probably the first.&nbsp;
Chance visitors like myself might give what they chose as a free-will
offering, but nothing was demanded.&nbsp; I may mention that when I
was going away, Father Michael refused twenty francs as excessive.&nbsp;
I explained the reasoning which led me to offer him so much; but even
then, from a curious point of honour, he would not accept it with his
own hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no right to refuse for the monastery,&rsquo;
he explained, &lsquo;but I should prefer if you would give it to one
of the brothers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had dined alone, because I arrived late; but at supper I found
two other guests.&nbsp; One was a country parish priest, who had walked
over that morning from the seat of his cure near Mende to enjoy four
days of solitude and prayer.&nbsp; He was a grenadier in person, with
the hale colour and circular wrinkles of a peasant; and as he complained
much of how he had been impeded by his skirts upon the march, I have
a vivid fancy portrait of him, striding along, upright, big-boned, with
kilted cassock, through the bleak hills of G&eacute;vaudan.&nbsp; The
other was a short, grizzling, thick-set man, from forty-five to fifty,
dressed in tweed with a knitted spencer, and the red ribbon of a decoration
in his button-hole.&nbsp; This last was a hard person to classify.&nbsp;
He was an old soldier, who had seen service and risen to the rank of
commandant; and he retained some of the brisk decisive manners of the
camp.&nbsp; On the other hand, as soon as his resignation was accepted,
he had come to Our Lady of the Snows as a boarder, and, after a brief
experience of its ways, had decided to remain as a novice.&nbsp; Already
the new life was beginning to modify his appearance; already he had
acquired somewhat of the quiet and smiling air of the brethren; and
he was as yet neither an officer nor a Trappist, but partook of the
character of each.&nbsp; And certainly here was a man in an interesting
nick of life.&nbsp; Out of the noise of cannon and trumpets, he was
in the act of passing into this still country bordering on the grave,
where men sleep nightly in their grave-clothes, and, like phantoms,
communicate by signs.</p>
<p>At supper we talked politics.&nbsp; I make it my business, when I
am in France, to preach political good-will and moderation, and to dwell
on the example of Poland, much as some alarmists in England dwell on
the example of Carthage.&nbsp; The priest and the commandant assured
me of their sympathy with all I said, and made a heavy sighing over
the bitterness of contemporary feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you cannot say anything to a man with which he does not
absolutely agree,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but he flies up at you in a
temper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They both declared that such a state of things was antichristian.</p>
<p>While we were thus agreeing, what should my tongue stumble upon but
a word in praise of Gambetta&rsquo;s moderation.&nbsp; The old soldier&rsquo;s
countenance was instantly suffused with blood; with the palms of his
hands he beat the table like a naughty child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Comment</i>, <i>monsieur</i>?&rsquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
<i>&lsquo;Comment</i>?&nbsp; Gambetta moderate?&nbsp; Will you dare
to justify these words?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the priest had not forgotten the tenor of our talk.&nbsp; And
suddenly, in the height of his fury, the old soldier found a warning
look directed on his face; the absurdity of his behaviour was brought
home to him in a flash; and the storm came to an abrupt end, without
another word.</p>
<p>It was only in the morning, over our coffee (Friday, September 27th),
that this couple found out I was a heretic.&nbsp; I suppose I had misled
them by some admiring expressions as to the monastic life around us;
and it was only by a point-blank question that the truth came out.&nbsp;
I had been tolerantly used both by simple Father Apollinaris and astute
Father Michael; and the good Irish deacon, when he heard of my religious
weakness, had only patted me upon the shoulder and said, &lsquo;You
must be a Catholic and come to heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I was now among
a different sect of orthodox.&nbsp; These two men were bitter and upright
and narrow, like the worst of Scotsmen, and indeed, upon my heart, I
fancy they were worse.&nbsp; The priest snorted aloud like a battle-horse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Et vous pr&eacute;tendez mourir dans cette esp&egrave;ce
de</i> <i>croyance</i>?&rsquo; he demanded; and there is no type used
by mortal printers large enough to qualify his accent.</p>
<p>I humbly indicated that I had no design of changing.</p>
<p>But he could not away with such a monstrous attitude.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
no,&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;you must change.&nbsp; You have come here,
God has led you here, and you must embrace the opportunity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I made a slip in policy; I appealed to the family affections, though
I was speaking to a priest and a soldier, two classes of men circumstantially
divorced from the kind and homely ties of life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your father and mother?&rsquo; cried the priest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
well; you will convert them in their turn when you go home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I think I see my father&rsquo;s face!&nbsp; I would rather tackle
the Gaetulian lion in his den than embark on such an enterprise against
the family theologian.</p>
<p>But now the hunt was up; priest and soldier were in full cry for
my conversion; and the Work of the Propagation of the Faith, for which
the people of Cheylard subscribed forty-eight francs ten centimes during
1877, was being gallantly pursued against myself.&nbsp; It was an odd
but most effective proselytising.&nbsp; They never sought to convince
me in argument, where I might have attempted some defence; but took
it for granted that I was both ashamed and terrified at my position,
and urged me solely on the point of time.&nbsp; Now, they said, when
God had led me to Our Lady of the Snows, now was the appointed hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be withheld by false shame,&rsquo; observed the priest,
for my encouragement.</p>
<p>For one who feels very similarly to all sects of religion, and who
has never been able, even for a moment, to weigh seriously the merit
of this or that creed on the eternal side of things, however much he
may see to praise or blame upon the secular and temporal side, the situation
thus created was both unfair and painful.&nbsp; I committed my second
fault in tact, and tried to plead that it was all the same thing in
the end, and we were all drawing near by different sides to the same
kind and undiscriminating Friend and Father.&nbsp; That, as it seems
to lay spirits, would be the only gospel worthy of the name.&nbsp; But
different men think differently; and this revolutionary aspiration brought
down the priest with all the terrors of the law.&nbsp; He launched into
harrowing details of hell.&nbsp; The damned, he said&mdash;on the authority
of a little book which he had read not a week before, and which, to
add conviction to conviction, he had fully intended to bring along with
him in his pocket&mdash;were to occupy the same attitude through all
eternity in the midst of dismal tortures.&nbsp; And as he thus expatiated,
he grew in nobility of aspect with his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>As a result the pair concluded that I should seek out the Prior,
since the Abbot was from home, and lay my case immediately before him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est mon conseil comme ancien</i> <i>militaire</i>,&rsquo;
observed the commandant; &lsquo;<i>et celui de monsieur</i> <i>comme</i>
<i>pr&ecirc;tre</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Oui</i>,&rsquo; added the <i>cur&eacute;</i>, sententiously
nodding; &lsquo;<i>comme</i> <i>ancien militaire&mdash;et comme pr&ecirc;tre</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, whilst I was somewhat embarrassed how to answer,
in came one of the monks, a little brown fellow, as lively as a grig,
and with an Italian accent, who threw himself at once into the contention,
but in a milder and more persuasive vein, as befitted one of these pleasant
brethren.&nbsp; Look at <i>him</i>, he said.&nbsp; The rule was very
hard; he would have dearly liked to stay in his own country, Italy&mdash;it
was well known how beautiful it was, the beautiful Italy; but then there
were no Trappists in Italy; and he had a soul to save; and here he was.</p>
<p>I am afraid I must be at bottom, what a cheerful Indian critic has
dubbed me, &lsquo;a faddling hedonist,&rsquo; for this description of
the brother&rsquo;s motives gave me somewhat of a shock.&nbsp; I should
have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake, and
not for ulterior purposes; and this shows how profoundly I was out of
sympathy with these good Trappists, even when I was doing my best to
sympathise.&nbsp; But to the <i>cur&eacute;</i> the argument seemed
decisive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear that!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I have seen a
marquis here, a marquis, a marquis&rsquo;&mdash;he repeated the holy
word three times over&mdash;&lsquo;and other persons high in society;
and generals.&nbsp; And here, at your side, is this gentleman, who has
been so many years in armies&mdash;decorated, an old warrior.&nbsp;
And here he is, ready to dedicate himself to God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was by this time so thoroughly embarrassed that I pled cold feet,
and made my escape from the apartment.&nbsp; It was a furious windy
morning, with a sky much cleared, and long and potent intervals of sunshine;
and I wandered until dinner in the wild country towards the east, sorely
staggered and beaten upon by the gale, but rewarded with some striking
views.</p>
<p>At dinner the Work of the Propagation of the Faith was recommenced,
and on this occasion still more distastefully to me.&nbsp; The priest
asked me many questions as to the contemptible faith of my fathers,
and received my replies with a kind of ecclesiastical titter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your sect,&rsquo; he said once; &lsquo;for I think you will
admit it would be doing it too much honour to call it a religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you please, monsieur,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>La
parole est &agrave; vous</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At length I grew annoyed beyond endurance; and although he was on
his own ground and, what is more to the purpose, an old man, and so
holding a claim upon my toleration, I could not avoid a protest against
this uncivil usage.&nbsp; He was sadly discountenanced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have no inclination
to laugh in my heart.&nbsp; I have no other feeling but interest in
your soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there ended my conversion.&nbsp; Honest man! he was no dangerous
deceiver; but a country parson, full of zeal and faith.&nbsp; Long may
he tread G&eacute;vaudan with his kilted skirts&mdash;a man strong to
walk and strong to comfort his parishioners in death!&nbsp; I daresay
he would beat bravely through a snowstorm where his duty called him;
and it is not always the most faithful believer who makes the cunningest
apostle.</p>
<h3>UPPER G&Eacute;VAUDAN (continued)</h3>
<blockquote><p>The bed was made, the room was fit,<br />
By punctual eve the stars were lit;<br />
The air was still, the water ran;<br />
No need there was for maid or man,<br />
When we put up, my ass and I,<br />
At God&rsquo;s green caravanserai.</p>
<p>OLD PLAY.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>ACROSS THE GOULET</h3>
<p>The wind fell during dinner, and the sky remained clear; so it was
under better auspices that I loaded Modestine before the monastery gate.&nbsp;
My Irish friend accompanied me so far on the way.&nbsp; As we came through
the wood, there was P&egrave;re Apollinaire hauling his barrow; and
he too quitted his labours to go with me for perhaps a hundred yards,
holding my hand between both of his in front of him.&nbsp; I parted
first from one and then from the other with unfeigned regret, but yet
with the glee of the traveller who shakes off the dust of one stage
before hurrying forth upon another.&nbsp; Then Modestine and I mounted
the course of the Allier, which here led us back into G&eacute;vaudan
towards its sources in the forest of Mercoire.&nbsp; It was but an inconsiderable
burn before we left its guidance.&nbsp; Thence, over a hill, our way
lay through a naked plateau, until we reached Chasserad&egrave;s at
sundown.</p>
<p>The company in the inn kitchen that night were all men employed in
survey for one of the projected railways.&nbsp; They were intelligent
and conversible, and we decided the future of France over hot wine,
until the state of the clock frightened us to rest.&nbsp; There were
four beds in the little upstairs room; and we slept six.&nbsp; But I
had a bed to myself, and persuaded them to leave the window open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>H&eacute;, bourgeois; il est cinq heures</i>!&rsquo; was
the cry that wakened me in the morning (Saturday, September 28th).&nbsp;
The room was full of a transparent darkness, which dimly showed me the
other three beds and the five different nightcaps on the pillows.&nbsp;
But out of the window the dawn was growing ruddy in a long belt over
the hill-tops, and day was about to flood the plateau.&nbsp; The hour
was inspiriting; and there seemed a promise of calm weather, which was
perfectly fulfilled.&nbsp; I was soon under way with Modestine.&nbsp;
The road lay for a while over the plateau, and then descended through
a precipitous village into the valley of the Chassezac.&nbsp; This stream
ran among green meadows, well hidden from the world by its steep banks;
the broom was in flower, and here and there was a hamlet sending up
its smoke.</p>
<p>At last the path crossed the Chassezac upon a bridge, and, forsaking
this deep hollow, set itself to cross the mountain of La Goulet.&nbsp;
It wound up through Lestampes by upland fields and woods of beech and
birch, and with every corner brought me into an acquaintance with some
new interest.&nbsp; Even in the gully of the Chassezac my ear had been
struck by a noise like that of a great bass bell ringing at the distance
of many miles; but this, as I continued to mount and draw nearer to
it, seemed to change in character, and I found at length that it came
from some one leading flocks afield to the note of a rural horn.&nbsp;
The narrow street of Lestampes stood full of sheep, from wall to wall&mdash;black
sheep and white, bleating with one accord like the birds in spring,
and each one accompanying himself upon the sheep-bell round his neck.&nbsp;
It made a pathetic concert, all in treble.&nbsp; A little higher, and
I passed a pair of men in a tree with pruning-hooks, and one of them
was singing the music of a <i>bourr&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp; Still further,
and when I was already threading the birches, the crowing of cocks came
cheerfully up to my ears, and along with that the voice of a flute discoursing
a deliberate and plaintive air from one of the upland villages.&nbsp;
I pictured to myself some grizzled, apple-cheeked, country schoolmaster
fluting in his bit of a garden in the clear autumn sunshine.&nbsp; All
these beautiful and interesting sounds filled my heart with an unwonted
expectation; and it appeared to me that, once past this range which
I was mounting, I should descend into the garden of the world.&nbsp;
Nor was I deceived, for I was now done with rains and winds and a bleak
country.&nbsp; The first part of my journey ended here; and this was
like an induction of sweet sounds into the other and more beautiful.</p>
<p>There are other degrees of <i>feyness</i>, as of punishment, besides
the capital; and I was now led by my good spirits into an adventure
which I relate in the interest of future donkey-drivers.&nbsp; The road
zigzagged so widely on the hillside, that I chose a short cut by map
and compass, and struck through the dwarf woods to catch the road again
upon a higher level.&nbsp; It was my one serious conflict with Modestine.&nbsp;
She would none of my short cut; she turned in my face; she backed, she
reared; she, whom I had hitherto imagined to be dumb, actually brayed
with a loud hoarse flourish, like a cock crowing for the dawn.&nbsp;
I plied the goad with one hand; with the other, so steep was the ascent,
I had to hold on the pack-saddle.&nbsp; Half-a-dozen times she was nearly
over backwards on the top of me; half-a-dozen times, from sheer weariness
of spirit, I was nearly giving it up, and leading her down again to
follow the road.&nbsp; But I took the thing as a wager, and fought it
through.&nbsp; I was surprised, as I went on my way again, by what appeared
to be chill rain-drops falling on my hand, and more than once looked
up in wonder at the cloudless sky.&nbsp; But it was only sweat which
came dropping from my brow.</p>
<p>Over the summit of the Goulet there was no marked road&mdash;only
upright stones posted from space to space to guide the drovers.&nbsp;
The turf underfoot was springy and well scented.&nbsp; I had no company
but a lark or two, and met but one bullock-cart between Lestampes and
Bleymard.&nbsp; In front of me I saw a shallow valley, and beyond that
the range of the Loz&egrave;re, sparsely wooded and well enough modelled
in the flanks, but straight and dull in outline.&nbsp; There was scarce
a sign of culture; only about Bleymard, the white high-road from Villefort
to Mende traversed a range of meadows, set with spiry poplars, and sounding
from side to side with the bells of flocks and herds.</p>
<h3>A NIGHT AMONG THE PINES</h3>
<p>From Bleymard after dinner, although it was already late, I set out
to scale a portion of the Loz&egrave;re.&nbsp; An ill-marked stony drove-road
guided me forward; and I met nearly half-a-dozen bullock-carts descending
from the woods, each laden with a whole pine-tree for the winter&rsquo;s
firing.&nbsp; At the top of the woods, which do not climb very high
upon this cold ridge, I struck leftward by a path among the pines, until
I hit on a dell of green turf, where a streamlet made a little spout
over some stones to serve me for a water-tap.&nbsp; &lsquo;In a more
sacred or sequestered bower . . . nor nymph nor faunus haunted.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The trees were not old, but they grew thickly round the glade: there
was no outlook, except north-eastward upon distant hill-tops, or straight
upward to the sky; and the encampment felt secure and private like a
room.&nbsp; By the time I had made my arrangements and fed Modestine,
the day was already beginning to decline.&nbsp; I buckled myself to
the knees into my sack and made a hearty meal; and as soon as the sun
went down, I pulled my cap over my eyes and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Night is a dead monotonous period under a roof; but in the open world
it passes lightly, with its stars and dews and perfumes, and the hours
are marked by changes in the face of Nature.&nbsp; What seems a kind
of temporal death to people choked between walls and curtains, is only
a light and living slumber to the man who sleeps afield.&nbsp; All night
long he can hear Nature breathing deeply and freely; even as she takes
her rest, she turns and smiles; and there is one stirring hour unknown
to those who dwell in houses, when a wakeful influence goes abroad over
the sleeping hemisphere, and all the outdoor world are on their feet.&nbsp;
It is then that the cock first crows, not this time to announce the
dawn, but like a cheerful watchman speeding the course of night.&nbsp;
Cattle awake on the meadows; sheep break their fast on dewy hillsides,
and change to a new lair among the ferns; and houseless men, who have
lain down with the fowls, open their dim eyes and behold the beauty
of the night.</p>
<p>At what inaudible summons, at what gentle touch of Nature, are all
these sleepers thus recalled in the same hour to life?&nbsp; Do the
stars rain down an influence, or do we share some thrill of mother earth
below our resting bodies?&nbsp; Even shepherds and old country-folk,
who are the deepest read in these arcana, have not a guess as to the
means or purpose of this nightly resurrection.&nbsp; Towards two in
the morning they declare the thing takes place; and neither know nor
inquire further.&nbsp; And at least it is a pleasant incident.&nbsp;
We are disturbed in our slumber only, like the luxurious Montaigne,
&lsquo;that we may the better and more sensibly relish it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We have a moment to look upon the stars.&nbsp; And there is a special
pleasure for some minds in the reflection that we share the impulse
with all outdoor creatures in our neighbourhood, that we have escaped
out of the Bastille of civilisation, and are become, for the time being,
a mere kindly animal and a sheep of Nature&rsquo;s flock.</p>
<p>When that hour came to me among the pines, I wakened thirsty.&nbsp;
My tin was standing by me half full of water.&nbsp; I emptied it at
a draught; and feeling broad awake after this internal cold aspersion,
sat upright to make a cigarette.&nbsp; The stars were clear, coloured,
and jewel-like, but not frosty.&nbsp; A faint silvery vapour stood for
the Milky Way.&nbsp; All around me the black fir-points stood upright
and stock-still.&nbsp; By the whiteness of the pack-saddle, I could
see Modestine walking round and round at the length of her tether; I
could hear her steadily munching at the sward; but there was not another
sound, save the indescribable quiet talk of the runnel over the stones.&nbsp;
I lay lazily smoking and studying the colour of the sky, as we call
the void of space, from where it showed a reddish grey behind the pines
to where it showed a glossy blue-black between the stars.&nbsp; As if
to be more like a pedlar, I wear a silver ring.&nbsp; This I could see
faintly shining as I raised or lowered the cigarette; and at each whiff
the inside of my hand was illuminated, and became for a second the highest
light in the landscape.</p>
<p>A faint wind, more like a moving coolness than a stream of air, passed
down the glade from time to time; so that even in my great chamber the
air was being renewed all night long.&nbsp; I thought with horror of
the inn at Chasserad&egrave;s and the congregated nightcaps; with horror
of the nocturnal prowesses of clerks and students, of hot theatres and
pass-keys and close rooms.&nbsp; I have not often enjoyed a more serene
possession of myself, nor felt more independent of material aids.&nbsp;
The outer world, from which we cower into our houses, seemed after all
a gentle habitable place; and night after night a man&rsquo;s bed, it
seemed, was laid and waiting for him in the fields, where God keeps
an open house.&nbsp; I thought I had rediscovered one of those truths
which are revealed to savages and hid from political economists: at
the least, I had discovered a new pleasure for myself.&nbsp; And yet
even while I was exulting in my solitude I became aware of a strange
lack.&nbsp; I wished a companion to lie near me in the starlight, silent
and not moving, but ever within touch.&nbsp; For there is a fellowship
more quiet even than solitude, and which, rightly understood, is solitude
made perfect.&nbsp; And to live out of doors with the woman a man loves
is of all lives the most complete and free.</p>
<p>As I thus lay, between content and longing, a faint noise stole towards
me through the pines.&nbsp; I thought, at first, it was the crowing
of cocks or the barking of dogs at some very distant farm; but steadily
and gradually it took articulate shape in my ears, until I became aware
that a passenger was going by upon the high-road in the valley, and
singing loudly as he went.&nbsp; There was more of good-will than grace
in his performance; but he trolled with ample lungs; and the sound of
his voice took hold upon the hillside and set the air shaking in the
leafy glens.&nbsp; I have heard people passing by night in sleeping
cities; some of them sang; one, I remember, played loudly on the bagpipes.&nbsp;
I have heard the rattle of a cart or carriage spring up suddenly after
hours of stillness, and pass, for some minutes, within the range of
my hearing as I lay abed.&nbsp; There is a romance about all who are
abroad in the black hours, and with something of a thrill we try to
guess their business.&nbsp; But here the romance was double: first,
this glad passenger, lit internally with wine, who sent up his voice
in music through the night; and then I, on the other hand, buckled into
my sack, and smoking alone in the pine-woods between four and five thousand
feet towards the stars.</p>
<p>When I awoke again (Sunday, 29th September), many of the stars had
disappeared; only the stronger companions of the night still burned
visibly overhead; and away towards the east I saw a faint haze of light
upon the horizon, such as had been the Milky Way when I was last awake.&nbsp;
Day was at hand.&nbsp; I lit my lantern, and by its glow-worm light
put on my boots and gaiters; then I broke up some bread for Modestine,
filled my can at the water-tap, and lit my spirit-lamp to boil myself
some chocolate.&nbsp; The blue darkness lay long in the glade where
I had so sweetly slumbered; but soon there was a broad streak of orange
melting into gold along the mountain-tops of Vivarais.&nbsp; A solemn
glee possessed my mind at this gradual and lovely coming in of day.&nbsp;
I heard the runnel with delight; I looked round me for something beautiful
and unexpected; but the still black pine-trees, the hollow glade, the
munching ass, remained unchanged in figure.&nbsp; Nothing had altered
but the light, and that, indeed, shed over all a spirit of life and
of breathing peace, and moved me to a strange exhilaration.</p>
<p>I drank my water-chocolate, which was hot if it was not rich, and
strolled here and there, and up and down about the glade.&nbsp; While
I was thus delaying, a gush of steady wind, as long as a heavy sigh,
poured direct out of the quarter of the morning.&nbsp; It was cold,
and set me sneezing.&nbsp; The trees near at hand tossed their black
plumes in its passage; and I could see the thin distant spires of pine
along the edge of the hill rock slightly to and fro against the golden
east.&nbsp; Ten minutes after, the sunlight spread at a gallop along
the hillside, scattering shadows and sparkles, and the day had come
completely.</p>
<p>I hastened to prepare my pack, and tackle the steep ascent that lay
before me; but I had something on my mind.&nbsp; It was only a fancy;
yet a fancy will sometimes be importunate.&nbsp; I had been most hospitably
received and punctually served in my green caravanserai.&nbsp; The room
was airy, the water excellent, and the dawn had called me to a moment.&nbsp;
I say nothing of the tapestries or the inimitable ceiling, nor yet of
the view which I commanded from the windows; but I felt I was in some
one&rsquo;s debt for all this liberal entertainment.&nbsp; And so it
pleased me, in a half-laughing way, to leave pieces of money on the
turf as I went along, until I had left enough for my night&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp;
I trust they did not fall to some rich and churlish drover.</p>

<h3>ACROSS THE LOZ&Egrave;RE</h3>
<p>The track that I had followed in the evening soon died out, and I
continued to follow over a bald turf ascent a row of stone pillars,
such as had conducted me across the Goulet.&nbsp; It was already warm.&nbsp;
I tied my jacket on the pack, and walked in my knitted waistcoat.&nbsp;
Modestine herself was in high spirits, and broke of her own accord,
for the first time in my experience, into a jolting trot that set the
oats swashing in the pocket of my coat.&nbsp; The view, back upon the
northern G&eacute;vaudan, extended with every step; scarce a tree, scarce
a house, appeared upon the fields of wild hill that ran north, east,
and west, all blue and gold in the haze and sunlight of the morning.&nbsp;
A multitude of little birds kept sweeping and twittering about my path;
they perched on the stone pillars, they pecked and strutted on the turf,
and I saw them circle in volleys in the blue air, and show, from time
to time, translucent flickering wings between the sun and me.</p>
<p>Almost from the first moment of my march, a faint large noise, like
a distant surf, had filled my ears.&nbsp; Sometimes I was tempted to
think it the voice of a neighbouring waterfall, and sometimes a subjective
result of the utter stillness of the hill.&nbsp; But as I continued
to advance, the noise increased, and became like the hissing of an enormous
tea-urn, and at the same time breaths of cool air began to reach me
from the direction of the summit.&nbsp; At length I understood.&nbsp;
It was blowing stiffly from the south upon the other slope of the Loz&egrave;re,
and every step that I took I was drawing nearer to the wind.</p>
<p>Although it had been long desired, it was quite unexpectedly at last
that my eyes rose above the summit.&nbsp; A step that seemed no way
more decisive than many other steps that had preceded it&mdash;and,
&lsquo;like stout Cortez when, with eagle eyes, he stared on the Pacific,&rsquo;
I took possession, in my own name, of a new quarter of the world.&nbsp;
For behold, instead of the gross turf rampart I had been mounting for
so long, a view into the hazy air of heaven, and a land of intricate
blue hills below my feet.</p>
<p>The Loz&egrave;re lies nearly east and west, cutting G&eacute;vaudan
into two unequal parts; its highest point, this Pic de Finiels, on which
I was then standing, rises upwards of five thousand six hundred feet
above the sea, and in clear weather commands a view over all lower Languedoc
to the Mediterranean Sea.&nbsp; I have spoken with people who either
pretended or believed that they had seen, from the Pic de Finiels, white
ships sailing by Montpellier and Cette.&nbsp; Behind was the upland
northern country through which my way had lain, peopled by a dull race,
without wood, without much grandeur of hill-form, and famous in the
past for little beside wolves.&nbsp; But in front of me, half veiled
in sunny haze, lay a new G&eacute;vaudan, rich, picturesque, illustrious
for stirring events.&nbsp; Speaking largely, I was in the Cevennes at
Monastier, and during all my journey; but there is a strict and local
sense in which only this confused and shaggy country at my feet has
any title to the name, and in this sense the peasantry employ the word.&nbsp;
These are the Cevennes with an emphasis: the Cevennes of the Cevennes.&nbsp;
In that undecipherable labyrinth of hills, a war of bandits, a war of
wild beasts, raged for two years between the Grand Monarch with all
his troops and marshals on the one hand, and a few thousand Protestant
mountaineers upon the other.&nbsp; A hundred and eighty years ago, the
Camisards held a station even on the Loz&egrave;re, where I stood; they
had an organisation, arsenals, a military and religious hierarchy; their
affairs were &lsquo;the discourse of every coffee-house&rsquo; in London;
England sent fleets in their support; their leaders prophesied and murdered;
with colours and drums, and the singing of old French psalms, their
bands sometimes affronted daylight, marched before walled cities, and
dispersed the generals of the king; and sometimes at night, or in masquerade,
possessed themselves of strong castles, and avenged treachery upon their
allies and cruelty upon their foes.&nbsp; There, a hundred and eighty
years ago, was the chivalrous Roland, &lsquo;Count and Lord Roland,
generalissimo of the Protestants in France,&rsquo; grave, silent, imperious,
pock-marked ex-dragoon, whom a lady followed in his wanderings out of
love.&nbsp; There was Cavalier, a baker&rsquo;s apprentice with a genius
for war, elected brigadier of Camisards at seventeen, to die at fifty-five
the English governor of Jersey.&nbsp; There again was Castanet, a partisan
leader in a voluminous peruke and with a taste for controversial divinity.&nbsp;
Strange generals, who moved apart to take counsel with the God of Hosts,
and fled or offered battle, set sentinels or slept in an unguarded camp,
as the Spirit whispered to their hearts!&nbsp; And there, to follow
these and other leaders, was the rank and file of prophets and disciples,
bold, patient, indefatigable, hardy to run upon the mountains, cheering
their rough life with psalms, eager to fight, eager to pray, listening
devoutly to the oracles of brain-sick children, and mystically putting
a grain of wheat among the pewter balls with which they charged their
muskets.</p>
<p>I had travelled hitherto through a dull district, and in the track
of nothing more notable than the child-eating beast of G&eacute;vaudan,
the Napoleon Bonaparte of wolves.&nbsp; But now I was to go down into
the scene of a romantic chapter&mdash;or, better, a romantic footnote
in the history of the world.&nbsp; What was left of all this bygone
dust and heroism?&nbsp; I was told that Protestantism still survived
in this head seat of Protestant resistance; so much the priest himself
had told me in the monastery parlour.&nbsp; But I had yet to learn if
it were a bare survival, or a lively and generous tradition.&nbsp; Again,
if in the northern Cevennes the people are narrow in religious judgments,
and more filled with zeal than charity, what was I to look for in this
land of persecution and reprisal&mdash;in a land where the tyranny of
the Church produced the Camisard rebellion, and the terror of the Camisards
threw the Catholic peasantry into legalised revolt upon the other side,
so that Camisard and Florentin skulked for each other&rsquo;s lives
among the mountains?</p>
<p>Just on the brow of the hill, where I paused to look before me, the
series of stone pillars came abruptly to an end; and only a little below,
a sort of track appeared and began to go down a break-neck slope, turning
like a corkscrew as it went.&nbsp; It led into a valley between falling
hills, stubbly with rocks like a reaped field of corn, and floored farther
down with green meadows.&nbsp; I followed the track with precipitation;
the steepness of the slope, the continual agile turning of the line
of the descent, and the old unwearied hope of finding something new
in a new country, all conspired to lend me wings.&nbsp; Yet a little
lower and a stream began, collecting itself together out of many fountains,
and soon making a glad noise among the hills.&nbsp; Sometimes it would
cross the track in a bit of waterfall, with a pool, in which Modestine
refreshed her feet.</p>
<p>The whole descent is like a dream to me, so rapidly was it accomplished.&nbsp;
I had scarcely left the summit ere the valley had closed round my path,
and the sun beat upon me, walking in a stagnant lowland atmosphere.&nbsp;
The track became a road, and went up and down in easy undulations.&nbsp;
I passed cabin after cabin, but all seemed deserted; and I saw not a
human creature, nor heard any sound except that of the stream.&nbsp;
I was, however, in a different country from the day before.&nbsp; The
stony skeleton of the world was here vigorously displayed to sun and
air.&nbsp; The slopes were steep and changeful.&nbsp; Oak-trees clung
along the hills, well grown, wealthy in leaf, and touched by the autumn
with strong and luminous colours.&nbsp; Here and there another stream
would fall in from the right or the left, down a gorge of snow-white
and tumultuary boulders.&nbsp; The river in the bottom (for it was rapidly
growing a river, collecting on all hands as it trotted on its way) here
foamed a while in desperate rapids, and there lay in pools of the most
enchanting sea-green shot with watery browns.&nbsp; As far as I have
gone, I have never seen a river of so changeful and delicate a hue;
crystal was not more clear, the meadows were not by half so green; and
at every pool I saw I felt a thrill of longing to be out of these hot,
dusty, and material garments, and bathe my naked body in the mountain
air and water.&nbsp; All the time as I went on I never forgot it was
the Sabbath; the stillness was a perpetual reminder; and I heard in
spirit the church-bells clamouring all over Europe, and the psalms of
a thousand churches.</p>
<p>At length a human sound struck upon my ear&mdash;a cry strangely
modulated between pathos and derision; and looking across the valley,
I saw a little urchin sitting in a meadow, with his hands about his
knees, and dwarfed to almost comical smallness by the distance.&nbsp;
But the rogue had picked me out as I went down the road, from oak wood
on to oak wood, driving Modestine; and he made me the compliments of
the new country in this tremulous high-pitched salutation.&nbsp; And
as all noises are lovely and natural at a sufficient distance, this
also, coming through so much clean hill air and crossing all the green
valley, sounded pleasant to my ear, and seemed a thing rustic, like
the oaks or the river.</p>
<p>A little after, the stream that I was following fell into the Tarn
at Pont de Montvert of bloody memory.</p>
<h3>PONT DE MONTVERT</h3>
<p>One of the first things I encountered in Pont de Montvert was, if
I remember rightly, the Protestant temple; but this was but the type
of other novelties.&nbsp; A subtle atmosphere distinguishes a town in
England from a town in France, or even in Scotland.&nbsp; At Carlisle
you can see you are in the one country; at Dumfries, thirty miles away,
you are as sure that you are in the other.&nbsp; I should find it difficult
to tell in what particulars Pont de Montvert differed from Monastier
or Langogne, or even Bleymard; but the difference existed, and spoke
eloquently to the eyes.&nbsp; The place, with its houses, its lanes,
its glaring river-bed, wore an indescribable air of the South.</p>
<p>All was Sunday bustle in the streets and in the public-house, as
all had been Sabbath peace among the mountains.&nbsp; There must have
been near a score of us at dinner by eleven before noon; and after I
had eaten and drunken, and sat writing up my journal, I suppose as many
more came dropping in one after another, or by twos and threes.&nbsp;
In crossing the Loz&egrave;re I had not only come among new natural
features, but moved into the territory of a different race.&nbsp; These
people, as they hurriedly despatched their viands in an intricate sword-play
of knives, questioned and answered me with a degree of intelligence
which excelled all that I had met, except among the railway folk at
Chasserad&egrave;s.&nbsp; They had open telling faces, and were lively
both in speech and manner.&nbsp; They not only entered thoroughly into
the spirit of my little trip, but more than one declared, if he were
rich enough, he would like to set forth on such another.</p>
<p>Even physically there was a pleasant change.&nbsp; I had not seen
a pretty woman since I left Monastier, and there but one.&nbsp; Now
of the three who sat down with me to dinner, one was certainly not beautiful&mdash;a
poor timid thing of forty, quite troubled at this roaring <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>,
whom I squired and helped to wine, and pledged and tried generally to
encourage, with quite a contrary effect; but the other two, both married,
were both more handsome than the average of women.&nbsp; And Clarisse?&nbsp;
What shall I say of Clarisse?&nbsp; She waited the table with a heavy
placable nonchalance, like a performing cow; her great grey eyes were
steeped in amorous languor; her features, although fleshy, were of an
original and accurate design; her mouth had a curl; her nostril spoke
of dainty pride; her cheek fell into strange and interesting lines.&nbsp;
It was a face capable of strong emotion, and, with training, it offered
the promise of delicate sentiment.&nbsp; It seemed pitiful to see so
good a model left to country admirers and a country way of thought.&nbsp;
Beauty should at least have touched society; then, in a moment, it throws
off a weight that lay upon it, it becomes conscious of itself, it puts
on an elegance, learns a gait and a carriage of the head, and, in a
moment, <i>patet dea</i>.&nbsp; Before I left I assured Clarisse of
my hearty admiration.&nbsp; She took it like milk, without embarrassment
or wonder, merely looking at me steadily with her great eyes; and I
own the result upon myself was some confusion.&nbsp; If Clarisse could
read English, I should not dare to add that her figure was unworthy
of her face.&nbsp; Hers was a case for stays; but that may perhaps grow
better as she gets up in years.</p>
<p>Pont de Montvert, or Greenhill Bridge, as we might say at home, is
a place memorable in the story of the Camisards.&nbsp; It was here that
the war broke out; here that those southern Covenanters slew their Archbishop
Sharp.&nbsp; The persecution on the one hand, the febrile enthusiasm
on the other, are almost equally difficult to understand in these quiet
modern days, and with our easy modern beliefs and disbeliefs.&nbsp;
The Protestants were one and all beside their right minds with zeal
and sorrow.&nbsp; They were all prophets and prophetesses.&nbsp; Children
at the breast would exhort their parents to good works.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
child of fifteen months at Quissac spoke from its mother&rsquo;s arms,
agitated and sobbing, distinctly and with a loud voice.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Marshal Villars has seen a town where all the women &lsquo;seemed possessed
by the devil,&rsquo; and had trembling fits, and uttered prophecies
publicly upon the streets.&nbsp; A prophetess of Vivarais was hanged
at Montpellier because blood flowed from her eyes and nose, and she
declared that she was weeping tears of blood for the misfortunes of
the Protestants.&nbsp; And it was not only women and children.&nbsp;
Stalwart dangerous fellows, used to swing the sickle or to wield the
forest axe, were likewise shaken with strange paroxysms, and spoke oracles
with sobs and streaming tears.&nbsp; A persecution unsurpassed in violence
had lasted near a score of years, and this was the result upon the persecuted;
hanging, burning, breaking on the wheel, had been in vain; the dragoons
had left their hoof-marks over all the countryside; there were men rowing
in the galleys, and women pining in the prisons of the Church; and not
a thought was changed in the heart of any upright Protestant.</p>
<p>Now the head and forefront of the persecution&mdash;after Lamoignon
de B&acirc;vile&mdash;Fran&ccedil;ois de Langlade du Chayla (pronounce
Ch&eacute;&iuml;la), Archpriest of the Cevennes and Inspector of Missions
in the same country, had a house in which he sometimes dwelt in the
town of Pont de Montvert.&nbsp; He was a conscientious person, who seems
to have been intended by nature for a pirate, and now fifty-five, an
age by which a man has learned all the moderation of which he is capable.&nbsp;
A missionary in his youth in China, he there suffered martyrdom, was
left for dead, and only succoured and brought back to life by the charity
of a pariah.&nbsp; We must suppose the pariah devoid of second-sight,
and not purposely malicious in this act.&nbsp; Such an experience, it
might be thought, would have cured a man of the desire to persecute;
but the human spirit is a thing strangely put together; and, having
been a Christian martyr, Du Chayla became a Christian persecutor.&nbsp;
The Work of the Propagation of the Faith went roundly forward in his
hands.&nbsp; His house in Pont de Montvert served him as a prison.&nbsp;
There he closed the hands of his prisoners upon live coal, and plucked
out the hairs of their beards, to convince them that they were deceived
in their opinions.&nbsp; And yet had not he himself tried and proved
the inefficacy of these carnal arguments among the Buddhists in China?</p>
<p>Not only was life made intolerable in Languedoc, but flight was rigidly
forbidden.&nbsp; One Massip, a muleteer, and well acquainted with the
mountain-paths, had already guided several troops of fugitives in safety
to Geneva; and on him, with another convoy, consisting mostly of women
dressed as men, Du Chayla, in an evil hour for himself, laid his hands.&nbsp;
The Sunday following, there was a conventicle of Protestants in the
woods of Altefage upon Mount Boug&egrave;s; where there stood up one
S&eacute;guier&mdash;Spirit S&eacute;guier, as his companions called
him&mdash;a wool-carder, tall, black-faced, and toothless, but a man
full of prophecy.&nbsp; He declared, in the name of God, that the time
for submission had gone by, and they must betake themselves to arms
for the deliverance of their brethren and the destruction of the priests.</p>
<p>The next night, 24th July 1702, a sound disturbed the Inspector of
Missions as he sat in his prison-house at Pont de Montvert: the voices
of many men upraised in psalmody drew nearer and nearer through the
town.&nbsp; It was ten at night; he had his court about him, priests,
soldiers, and servants, to the number of twelve or fifteen; and now
dreading the insolence of a conventicle below his very windows, he ordered
forth his soldiers to report.&nbsp; But the psalm-singers were already
at his door, fifty strong, led by the inspired S&eacute;guier, and breathing
death.&nbsp; To their summons, the archpriest made answer like a stout
old persecutor, and bade his garrison fire upon the mob.&nbsp; One Camisard
(for, according to some, it was in this night&rsquo;s work that they
came by the name) fell at this discharge: his comrades burst in the
door with hatchets and a beam of wood, overran the lower story of the
house, set free the prisoners, and finding one of them in the <i>vine</i>,
a sort of Scavenger&rsquo;s Daughter of the place and period, redoubled
in fury against Du Chayla, and sought by repeated assaults to carry
the upper floors.&nbsp; But he, on his side, had given absolution to
his men, and they bravely held the staircase.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Children of God,&rsquo; cried the prophet, &lsquo;hold your
hands.&nbsp; Let us burn the house, with the priest and the satellites
of Baal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fire caught readily.&nbsp; Out of an upper window Du Chayla and
his men lowered themselves into the garden by means of knotted sheets;
some escaped across the river under the bullets of the insurgents; but
the archpriest himself fell, broke his thigh, and could only crawl into
the hedge.&nbsp; What were his reflections as this second martyrdom
drew near?&nbsp; A poor, brave, besotted, hateful man, who had done
his duty resolutely according to his light both in the Cevennes and
China.&nbsp; He found at least one telling word to say in his defence;
for when the roof fell in and the upbursting flames discovered his retreat,
and they came and dragged him to the public place of the town, raging
and calling him damned&mdash;&lsquo;If I be damned,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;why should you also damn yourselves?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here was a good reason for the last; but in the course of his inspectorship
he had given many stronger which all told in a contrary direction; and
these he was now to hear.&nbsp; One by one, S&eacute;guier first, the
Camisards drew near and stabbed him.&nbsp; &lsquo;This,&rsquo; they
said, &lsquo;is for my father broken on the wheel.&nbsp; This for my
brother in the galleys.&nbsp; That for my mother or my sister imprisoned
in your cursed convents.&rsquo;&nbsp; Each gave his blow and his reason;
and then all kneeled and sang psalms around the body till the dawn.&nbsp;
With the dawn, still singing, they defiled away towards Frug&egrave;res,
farther up the Tarn, to pursue the work of vengeance, leaving Du Chayla&rsquo;s
prison-house in ruins, and his body pierced with two-and-fifty wounds
upon the public place.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis a wild night&rsquo;s work, with its accompaniment of psalms;
and it seems as if a psalm must always have a sound of threatening in
that town upon the Tarn.&nbsp; But the story does not end, even so far
as concerns Pont de Montvert, with the departure of the Camisards.&nbsp;
The career of S&eacute;guier was brief and bloody.&nbsp; Two more priests
and a whole family at Ladev&egrave;ze, from the father to the servants,
fell by his hand or by his orders; and yet he was but a day or two at
large, and restrained all the time by the presence of the soldiery.&nbsp;
Taken at length by a famous soldier of fortune, Captain Poul, he appeared
unmoved before his judges.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your name?&rsquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pierre S&eacute;guier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are you called Spirit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because the Spirit of the Lord is with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your domicile?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lately in the desert, and soon in heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you no remorse for your crimes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have committed none.&nbsp; <i>My soul is like a garden full
of shelter and of fountains.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>At Pont de Montvert, on the 12th of August, he had his right hand
stricken from his body, and was burned alive.&nbsp; And his soul was
like a garden?&nbsp; So perhaps was the soul of Du Chayla, the Christian
martyr.&nbsp; And perhaps if you could read in my soul, or I could read
in yours, our own composure might seem little less surprising.</p>
<p>Du Chayla&rsquo;s house still stands, with a new roof, beside one
of the bridges of the town; and if you are curious you may see the terrace-garden
into which he dropped.</p>
<h3>IN THE VALLEY OF THE TARN</h3>
<p>A new road leads from Pont de Montvert to Florac by the valley of
the Tarn; a smooth sandy ledge, it runs about half-way between the summit
of the cliffs and the river in the bottom of the valley; and I went
in and out, as I followed it, from bays of shadow into promontories
of afternoon sun.&nbsp; This was a pass like that of Killiecrankie;
a deep turning gully in the hills, with the Tarn making a wonderful
hoarse uproar far below, and craggy summits standing in the sunshine
high above.&nbsp; A thin fringe of ash-trees ran about the hill-tops,
like ivy on a ruin; but on the lower slopes, and far up every glen,
the Spanish chestnut-trees stood each four-square to heaven under its
tented foliage.&nbsp; Some were planted, each on its own terrace no
larger than a bed; some, trusting in their roots, found strength to
grow and prosper and be straight and large upon the rapid slopes of
the valley; others, where there was a margin to the river, stood marshalled
in a line and mighty like cedars of Lebanon.&nbsp; Yet even where they
grew most thickly they were not to be thought of as a wood, but as a
herd of stalwart individuals; and the dome of each tree stood forth
separate and large, and as it were a little hill, from among the domes
of its companions.&nbsp; They gave forth a faint sweet perfume which
pervaded the air of the afternoon; autumn had put tints of gold and
tarnish in the green; and the sun so shone through and kindled the broad
foliage, that each chestnut was relieved against another, not in shadow,
but in light.&nbsp; A humble sketcher here laid down his pencil in despair.</p>
<p>I wish I could convey a notion of the growth of these noble trees;
of how they strike out boughs like the oak, and trail sprays of drooping
foliage like the willow; of how they stand on upright fluted columns
like the pillars of a church; or like the olive, from the most shattered
bole can put out smooth and youthful shoots, and begin a new life upon
the ruins of the old.&nbsp; Thus they partake of the nature of many
different trees; and even their prickly top-knots, seen near at hand
against the sky, have a certain palm-like air that impresses the imagination.&nbsp;
But their individuality, although compounded of so many elements, is
but the richer and the more original.&nbsp; And to look down upon a
level filled with these knolls of foliage, or to see a clan of old unconquerable
chestnuts cluster &lsquo;like herded elephants&rsquo; upon the spur
of a mountain, is to rise to higher thoughts of the powers that are
in Nature.</p>
<p>Between Modestine&rsquo;s laggard humour and the beauty of the scene,
we made little progress all that afternoon; and at last finding the
sun, although still far from setting, was already beginning to desert
the narrow valley of the Tarn, I began to cast about for a place to
camp in.&nbsp; This was not easy to find; the terraces were too narrow,
and the ground, where it was unterraced, was usually too steep for a
man to lie upon.&nbsp; I should have slipped all night, and awakened
towards morning with my feet or my head in the river.</p>
<p>After perhaps a mile, I saw, some sixty feet above the road, a little
plateau large enough to hold my sack, and securely parapeted by the
trunk of an aged and enormous chestnut.&nbsp; Thither, with infinite
trouble, I goaded and kicked the reluctant Modestine, and there I hastened
to unload her.&nbsp; There was only room for myself upon the plateau,
and I had to go nearly as high again before I found so much as standing-room
for the ass.&nbsp; It was on a heap of rolling stones, on an artificial
terrace, certainly not five feet square in all.&nbsp; Here I tied her
to a chestnut, and having given her corn and bread and made a pile of
chestnut-leaves, of which I found her greedy, I descended once more
to my own encampment.</p>
<p>The position was unpleasantly exposed.&nbsp; One or two carts went
by upon the road; and as long as daylight lasted I concealed myself,
for all the world like a hunted Camisard, behind my fortification of
vast chestnut trunk; for I was passionately afraid of discovery and
the visit of jocular persons in the night.&nbsp; Moreover, I saw that
I must be early awake; for these chestnut gardens had been the scene
of industry no further gone than on the day before.&nbsp; The slope
was strewn with lopped branches, and here and there a great package
of leaves was propped against a trunk; for even the leaves are serviceable,
and the peasants use them in winter by way of fodder for their animals.&nbsp;
I picked a meal in fear and trembling, half lying down to hide myself
from the road; and I daresay I was as much concerned as if I had been
a scout from Joani&rsquo;s band above upon the Loz&egrave;re, or from
Salomon&rsquo;s across the Tarn, in the old times of psalm-singing and
blood.&nbsp; Or, indeed, perhaps more; for the Camisards had a remarkable
confidence in God; and a tale comes back into my memory of how the Count
of G&eacute;vaudan, riding with a party of dragoons and a notary at
his saddlebow to enforce the oath of fidelity in all the country hamlets,
entered a valley in the woods, and found Cavalier and his men at dinner,
gaily seated on the grass, and their hats crowned with box-tree garlands,
while fifteen women washed their linen in the stream.&nbsp; Such was
a field festival in 1703; at that date Antony Watteau would be painting
similar subjects.</p>
<p>This was a very different camp from that of the night before in the
cool and silent pine-woods.&nbsp; It was warm and even stifling in the
valley.&nbsp; The shrill song of frogs, like the tremolo note of a whistle
with a pea in it, rang up from the river-side before the sun was down.&nbsp;
In the growing dusk, faint rustlings began to run to and fro among the
fallen leaves; from time to time a faint chirping or cheeping noise
would fall upon my ear; and from time to time I thought I could see
the movement of something swift and indistinct between the chestnuts.&nbsp;
A profusion of large ants swarmed upon the ground; bats whisked by,
and mosquitoes droned overhead.&nbsp; The long boughs with their bunches
of leaves hung against the sky like garlands; and those immediately
above and around me had somewhat the air of a trellis which should have
been wrecked and half overthrown in a gale of wind.</p>
<p>Sleep for a long time fled my eyelids; and just as I was beginning
to feel quiet stealing over my limbs, and settling densely on my mind,
a noise at my head startled me broad awake again, and, I will frankly
confess it, brought my heart into my mouth.</p>
<p>It was such a noise as a person would make scratching loudly with
a finger-nail; it came from under the knapsack which served me for a
pillow, and it was thrice repeated before I had time to sit up and turn
about.&nbsp; Nothing was to be seen, nothing more was to be heard, but
a few of these mysterious rustlings far and near, and the ceaseless
accompaniment of the river and the frogs.&nbsp; I learned next day that
the chestnut gardens are infested by rats; rustling, chirping, and scraping
were probably all due to these; but the puzzle, for the moment, was
insoluble, and I had to compose myself for sleep, as best I could, in
wondering uncertainty about my neighbours.</p>
<p>I was wakened in the grey of the morning (Monday, 30th September)
by the sound of foot-steps not far off upon the stones, and opening
my eyes, I beheld a peasant going by among the chestnuts by a footpath
that I had not hitherto observed.&nbsp; He turned his head neither to
the right nor to the left, and disappeared in a few strides among the
foliage.&nbsp; Here was an escape!&nbsp; But it was plainly more than
time to be moving.&nbsp; The peasantry were abroad; scarce less terrible
to me in my nondescript position than the soldiers of Captain Poul to
an undaunted Camisard.&nbsp; I fed Modestine with what haste I could;
but as I was returning to my sack, I saw a man and a boy come down the
hillside in a direction crossing mine.&nbsp; They unintelligibly hailed
me, and I replied with inarticulate but cheerful sounds, and hurried
forward to get into my gaiters.</p>
<p>The pair, who seemed to be father and son, came slowly up to the
plateau, and stood close beside me for some time in silence.&nbsp; The
bed was open, and I saw with regret my revolver lying patently disclosed
on the blue wool.&nbsp; At last, after they had looked me all over,
and the silence had grown laughably embarrassing, the man demanded in
what seemed unfriendly tones:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have slept here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;As you see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My faith,&rsquo; I answered lightly, &lsquo;I was tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He next inquired where I was going and what I had had for dinner;
and then, without the least transition, &lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est bien</i>,&rsquo;
he added, &lsquo;come along.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he and his son, without
another word, turned off to the next chestnut-tree but one, which they
set to pruning.&nbsp; The thing had passed of more simply than I hoped.&nbsp;
He was a grave, respectable man; and his unfriendly voice did not imply
that he thought he was speaking to a criminal, but merely to an inferior.</p>
<p>I was soon on the road, nibbling a cake of chocolate and seriously
occupied with a case of conscience.&nbsp; Was I to pay for my night&rsquo;s
lodging?&nbsp; I had slept ill, the bed was full of fleas in the shape
of ants, there was no water in the room, the very dawn had neglected
to call me in the morning.&nbsp; I might have missed a train, had there
been any in the neighbourhood to catch.&nbsp; Clearly, I was dissatisfied
with my entertainment; and I decided I should not pay unless I met a
beggar.</p>
<p>The valley looked even lovelier by morning; and soon the road descended
to the level of the river.&nbsp; Here, in a place where many straight
and prosperous chestnuts stood together, making an aisle upon a swarded
terrace, I made my morning toilette in the water of the Tarn.&nbsp;
It was marvellously clear, thrillingly cool; the soap-suds disappeared
as if by magic in the swift current, and the white boulders gave one
a model for cleanliness.&nbsp; To wash in one of God&rsquo;s rivers
in the open air seems to me a sort of cheerful solemnity or semi-pagan
act of worship.&nbsp; To dabble among dishes in a bedroom may perhaps
make clean the body; but the imagination takes no share in such a cleansing.&nbsp;
I went on with a light and peaceful heart, and sang psalms to the spiritual
ear as I advanced.</p>
<p>Suddenly up came an old woman, who point-blank demanded alms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; thought I; &lsquo;here comes the waiter with
the bill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I paid for my night&rsquo;s lodging on the spot.&nbsp; Take it
how you please, but this was the first and the last beggar that I met
with during all my tour.</p>
<p>A step or two farther I was overtaken by an old man in a brown nightcap,
clear-eyed, weather-beaten, with a faint excited smile.&nbsp; A little
girl followed him, driving two sheep and a goat; but she kept in our
wake, while the old man walked beside me and talked about the morning
and the valley.&nbsp; It was not much past six; and for healthy people
who have slept enough, that is an hour of expansion and of open and
trustful talk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Connaissez-vous le Seigneur</i>?&rsquo; he said at length.</p>
<p>I asked him what Seigneur he meant; but he only repeated the question
with more emphasis and a look in his eyes denoting hope and interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said I, pointing upwards, &lsquo;I understand you
now.&nbsp; Yes, I know Him; He is the best of acquaintances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man said he was delighted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold,&rsquo; he added,
striking his bosom; &lsquo;it makes me happy here.&rsquo;&nbsp; There
were a few who knew the Lord in these valleys, he went on to tell me;
not many, but a few.&nbsp; &lsquo;Many are called,&rsquo; he quoted,
&lsquo;and few chosen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it is not easy to say who
know the Lord; and it is none of our business.&nbsp; Protestants and
Catholics, and even those who worship stones, may know Him and be known
by Him; for He has made all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I did not know I was so good a preacher.</p>
<p>The old man assured me he thought as I did, and repeated his expressions
of pleasure at meeting me.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are so few,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They call us Moravians here; but down in the Department of Gard,
where there are also a good number, they are called Derbists, after
an English pastor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I began to understand that I was figuring, in questionable taste,
as a member of some sect to me unknown; but I was more pleased with
the pleasure of my companion than embarrassed by my own equivocal position.&nbsp;
Indeed, I can see no dishonesty in not avowing a difference; and especially
in these high matters, where we have all a sufficient assurance that,
whoever may be in the wrong, we ourselves are not completely in the
right.&nbsp; The truth is much talked about; but this old man in a brown
nightcap showed himself so simple, sweet, and friendly, that I am not
unwilling to profess myself his convert.&nbsp; He was, as a matter of
fact, a Plymouth Brother.&nbsp; Of what that involves in the way of
doctrine I have no idea nor the time to inform myself; but I know right
well that we are all embarked upon a troublesome world, the children
of one Father, striving in many essential points to do and to become
the same.&nbsp; And although it was somewhat in a mistake that he shook
hands with me so often and showed himself so ready to receive my words,
that was a mistake of the truth-finding sort.&nbsp; For charity begins
blindfold; and only through a series of similar misapprehensions rises
at length into a settled principle of love and patience, and a firm
belief in all our fellow-men.&nbsp; If I deceived this good old man,
in the like manner I would willingly go on to deceive others.&nbsp;
And if ever at length, out of our separate and sad ways, we should all
come together into one common house, I have a hope, to which I cling
dearly, that my mountain Plymouth Brother will hasten to shake hands
with me again.</p>
<p>Thus, talking like Christian and Faithful by the way, he and I came
down upon a hamlet by the Tarn.&nbsp; It was but a humble place, called
La Vern&egrave;de, with less than a dozen houses, and a Protestant chapel
on a knoll.&nbsp; Here he dwelt; and here, at the inn, I ordered my
breakfast.&nbsp; The inn was kept by an agreeable young man, a stone-breaker
on the road, and his sister, a pretty and engaging girl.&nbsp; The village
schoolmaster dropped in to speak with the stranger.&nbsp; And these
were all Protestants&mdash;a fact which pleased me more than I should
have expected; and, what pleased me still more, they seemed all upright
and simple people.&nbsp; The Plymouth Brother hung round me with a sort
of yearning interest, and returned at least thrice to make sure I was
enjoying my meal.&nbsp; His behaviour touched me deeply at the time,
and even now moves me in recollection.&nbsp; He feared to intrude, but
he would not willingly forego one moment of my society; and he seemed
never weary of shaking me by the hand.</p>
<p>When all the rest had drifted off to their day&rsquo;s work, I sat
for near half an hour with the young mistress of the house, who talked
pleasantly over her seam of the chestnut harvest, and the beauties of
the Tarn, and old family affections, broken up when young folk go from
home, yet still subsisting.&nbsp; Hers, I am sure, was a sweet nature,
with a country plainness and much delicacy underneath; and he who takes
her to his heart will doubtless be a fortunate young man.</p>
<p>The valley below La Vern&egrave;de pleased me more and more as I
went forward.&nbsp; Now the hills approached from either hand, naked
and crumbling, and walled in the river between cliffs; and now the valley
widened and became green.&nbsp; The road led me past the old castle
of Miral on a steep; past a battlemented monastery, long since broken
up and turned into a church and parsonage; and past a cluster of black
roofs, the village of Cocur&egrave;s, sitting among vineyards, and meadows,
and orchards thick with red apples, and where, along the highway, they
were knocking down walnuts from the roadside trees, and gathering them
in sacks and baskets.&nbsp; The hills, however much the vale might open,
were still tall and bare, with cliffy battlements and here and there
a pointed summit; and the Tarn still rattled through the stones with
a mountain noise.&nbsp; I had been led, by bagmen of a picturesque turn
of mind, to expect a horrific country after the heart of Byron; but
to my Scottish eyes it seemed smiling and plentiful, as the weather
still gave an impression of high summer to my Scottish body; although
the chestnuts were already picked out by the autumn, and the poplars,
that here began to mingle with them, had turned into pale gold against
the approach of winter.</p>
<p>There was something in this landscape, smiling although wild, that
explained to me the spirit of the Southern Covenanters.&nbsp; Those
who took to the hills for conscience&rsquo; sake in Scotland had all
gloomy and bedevilled thoughts; for once that they received God&rsquo;s
comfort they would be twice engaged with Satan; but the Camisards had
only bright and supporting visions.&nbsp; They dealt much more in blood,
both given and taken; yet I find no obsession of the Evil One in their
records.&nbsp; With a light conscience, they pursued their life in these
rough times and circumstances.&nbsp; The soul of S&eacute;guier, let
us not forget, was like a garden.&nbsp; They knew they were on God&rsquo;s
side, with a knowledge that has no parallel among the Scots; for the
Scots, although they might be certain of the cause, could never rest
confident of the person.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We flew,&rsquo; says one old Camisard, &lsquo;when we heard
the sound of psalm-singing, we flew as if with wings.&nbsp; We felt
within us an animating ardour, a transporting desire.&nbsp; The feeling
cannot be expressed in words.&nbsp; It is a thing that must have been
experienced to be understood.&nbsp; However weary we might be, we thought
no more of our weariness, and grew light so soon as the psalms fell
upon our ears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The valley of the Tarn and the people whom I met at La Vern&egrave;de
not only explain to me this passage, but the twenty years of suffering
which those, who were so stiff and so bloody when once they betook themselves
to war, endured with the meekness of children and the constancy of saints
and peasants.</p>
<h3>FLORAC</h3>
<p>On a branch of the Tarn stands Florac, the seat of a sub-prefecture,
with an old castle, an alley of planes, many quaint street-corners,
and a live fountain welling from the hill.&nbsp; It is notable, besides,
for handsome women, and as one of the two capitals, Alais being the
other, of the country of the Camisards.</p>
<p>The landlord of the inn took me, after I had eaten, to an adjoining
caf&eacute;, where I, or rather my journey, became the topic of the
afternoon.&nbsp; Every one had some suggestion for my guidance; and
the sub-prefectorial map was fetched from the sub-prefecture itself,
and much thumbed among coffee-cups and glasses of liqueur.&nbsp; Most
of these kind advisers were Protestant, though I observed that Protestant
and Catholic intermingled in a very easy manner; and it surprised me
to see what a lively memory still subsisted of the religious war.&nbsp;
Among the hills of the south-west, by Mauchline, Cumnock, or Carsphairn,
in isolated farms or in the manse, serious Presbyterian people still
recall the days of the great persecution, and the graves of local martyrs
are still piously regarded.&nbsp; But in towns and among the so-called
better classes, I fear that these old doings have become an idle tale.&nbsp;
If you met a mixed company in the King&rsquo;s Arms at Wigton, it is
not likely that the talk would run on Covenanters.&nbsp; Nay, at Muirkirk
of Glenluce, I found the beadle&rsquo;s wife had not so much as heard
of Prophet Peden.&nbsp; But these C&eacute;venols were proud of their
ancestors in quite another sense; the war was their chosen topic; its
exploits were their own patent of nobility; and where a man or a race
has had but one adventure, and that heroic, we must expect and pardon
some prolixity of reference.&nbsp; They told me the country was still
full of legends hitherto uncollected; I heard from them about Cavalier&rsquo;s
descendants&mdash;not direct descendants, be it understood, but only
cousins or nephews&mdash;who were still prosperous people in the scene
of the boy-general&rsquo;s exploits; and one farmer had seen the bones
of old combatants dug up into the air of an afternoon in the nineteenth
century, in a field where the ancestors had fought, and the great-grandchildren
were peaceably ditching.</p>
<p>Later in the day one of the Protestant pastors was so good as to
visit me: a young man, intelligent and polite, with whom I passed an
hour or two in talk.&nbsp; Florac, he told me, is part Protestant, part
Catholic; and the difference in religion is usually doubled by a difference
in politics.&nbsp; You may judge of my surprise, coming as I did from
such a babbling purgatorial Poland of a place as Monastier, when I learned
that the population lived together on very quiet terms; and there was
even an exchange of hospitalities between households thus doubly separated.&nbsp;
Black Camisard and White Camisard, militiaman and Miquelet and dragoon,
Protestant prophet and Catholic cadet of the White Cross, they had all
been sabring and shooting, burning, pillaging, and murdering, their
hearts hot with indignant passion; and here, after a hundred and seventy
years, Protestant is still Protestant, Catholic still Catholic, in mutual
toleration and mild amity of life.&nbsp; But the race of man, like that
indomitable nature whence it sprang, has medicating virtues of its own;
the years and seasons bring various harvests; the sun returns after
the rain; and mankind outlives secular animosities, as a single man
awakens from the passions of a day.&nbsp; We judge our ancestors from
a more divine position; and the dust being a little laid with several
centuries, we can see both sides adorned with human virtues and fighting
with a show of right.</p>
<p>I have never thought it easy to be just, and find it daily even harder
than I thought.&nbsp; I own I met these Protestants with a delight and
a sense of coming home.&nbsp; I was accustomed to speak their language,
in another and deeper sense of the word than that which distinguishes
between French and English; for the true Babel is a divergence upon
morals.&nbsp; And hence I could hold more free communication with the
Protestants, and judge them more justly, than the Catholics.&nbsp; Father
Apollinaris may pair off with my mountain Plymouth Brother as two guileless
and devout old men; yet I ask myself if I had as ready a feeling for
the virtues of the Trappist; or, had I been a Catholic, if I should
have felt so warmly to the dissenter of La Vern&egrave;de.&nbsp; With
the first I was on terms of mere forbearance; but with the other, although
only on a misunderstanding and by keeping on selected points, it was
still possible to hold converse and exchange some honest thoughts.&nbsp;
In this world of imperfection we gladly welcome even partial intimacies.&nbsp;
And if we find but one to whom we can speak out of our heart freely,
with whom we can walk in love and simplicity without dissimulation,
we have no ground of quarrel with the world or God.</p>
<h3>IN THE VALLEY OF THE MIMENTE</h3>
<p>On Tuesday, 1st October, we left Florac late in the afternoon, a
tired donkey and tired donkey-driver.&nbsp; A little way up the Tarnon,
a covered bridge of wood introduced us into the valley of the Mimente.&nbsp;
Steep rocky red mountains overhung the stream; great oaks and chestnuts
grew upon the slopes or in stony terraces; here and there was a red
field of millet or a few apple-trees studded with red apples; and the
road passed hard by two black hamlets, one with an old castle atop to
please the heart of the tourist.</p>
<p>It was difficult here again to find a spot fit for my encampment.&nbsp;
Even under the oaks and chestnuts the ground had not only a very rapid
slope, but was heaped with loose stones; and where there was no timber
the hills descended to the stream in a red precipice tufted with heather.&nbsp;
The sun had left the highest peak in front of me, and the valley was
full of the lowing sound of herdsmen&rsquo;s horns as they recalled
the flocks into the stable, when I spied a bight of meadow some way
below the roadway in an angle of the river.&nbsp; Thither I descended,
and, tying Modestine provisionally to a tree, proceeded to investigate
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; A grey pearly evening shadow filled the glen;
objects at a little distance grew indistinct and melted bafflingly into
each other; and the darkness was rising steadily like an exhalation.&nbsp;
I approached a great oak which grew in the meadow, hard by the river&rsquo;s
brink; when to my disgust the voices of children fell upon my ear, and
I beheld a house round the angle on the other bank.&nbsp; I had half
a mind to pack and be gone again, but the growing darkness moved me
to remain.&nbsp; I had only to make no noise until the night was fairly
come, and trust to the dawn to call me early in the morning.&nbsp; But
it was hard to be annoyed by neighbours in such a great hotel.</p>
<p>A hollow underneath the oak was my bed.&nbsp; Before I had fed Modestine
and arranged my sack, three stars were already brightly shining, and
the others were beginning dimly to appear.&nbsp; I slipped down to the
river, which looked very black among its rocks, to fill my can; and
dined with a good appetite in the dark, for I scrupled to light a lantern
while so near a house.&nbsp; The moon, which I had seen a pallid crescent
all afternoon, faintly illuminated the summit of the hills, but not
a ray fell into the bottom of the glen where I was lying.&nbsp; The
oak rose before me like a pillar of darkness; and overhead the heartsome
stars were set in the face of the night.&nbsp; No one knows the stars
who has not slept, as the French happily put it, <i>&agrave;</i> <i>la</i>
<i>belle &eacute;toile</i>.&nbsp; He may know all their names and distances
and magnitudes, and yet be ignorant of what alone concerns mankind,&mdash;their
serene and gladsome influence on the mind.&nbsp; The greater part of
poetry is about the stars; and very justly, for they are themselves
the most classical of poets.&nbsp; These same far-away worlds, sprinkled
like tapers or shaken together like a diamond dust upon the sky, had
looked not otherwise to Roland or Cavalier, when, in the words of the
latter, they had &lsquo;no other tent but the sky, and no other bed
than my mother earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All night a strong wind blew up the valley, and the acorns fell pattering
over me from the oak.&nbsp; Yet, on this first night of October, the
air was as mild as May, and I slept with the fur thrown back.</p>
<p>I was much disturbed by the barking of a dog, an animal that I fear
more than any wolf.&nbsp; A dog is vastly braver, and is besides supported
by the sense of duty.&nbsp; If you kill a wolf, you meet with encouragement
and praise; but if you kill a dog, the sacred rights of property and
the domestic affections come clamouring round you for redress.&nbsp;
At the end of a fagging day, the sharp cruel note of a dog&rsquo;s bark
is in itself a keen annoyance; and to a tramp like myself, he represents
the sedentary and respectable world in its most hostile form.&nbsp;
There is something of the clergyman or the lawyer about this engaging
animal; and if he were not amenable to stones, the boldest man would
shrink from travelling afoot.&nbsp; I respect dogs much in the domestic
circle; but on the highway, or sleeping afield, I both detest and fear
them.</p>
<p>I was wakened next morning (Wednesday, October 2nd) by the same dog&mdash;for
I knew his bark&mdash;making a charge down the bank, and then, seeing
me sit up, retreating again with great alacrity.&nbsp; The stars were
not yet quite extinguished.&nbsp; The heaven was of that enchanting
mild grey-blue of the early morn.&nbsp; A still clear light began to
fall, and the trees on the hillside were outlined sharply against the
sky.&nbsp; The wind had veered more to the north, and no longer reached
me in the glen; but as I was going on with my preparations, it drove
a white cloud very swiftly over the hill-top; and looking up, I was
surprised to see the cloud dyed with gold.&nbsp; In these high regions
of the air, the sun was already shining as at noon.&nbsp; If only the
clouds travelled high enough, we should see the same thing all night
long.&nbsp; For it is always daylight in the fields of space.</p>
<p>As I began to go up the valley, a draught of wind came down it out
of the seat of the sunrise, although the clouds continued to run overhead
in an almost contrary direction.&nbsp; A few steps farther, and I saw
a whole hillside gilded with the sun; and still a little beyond, between
two peaks, a centre of dazzling brilliancy appeared floating in the
sky, and I was once more face to face with the big bonfire that occupies
the kernel of our system.</p>
<p>I met but one human being that forenoon, a dark military-looking
wayfarer, who carried a game-bag on a baldric; but he made a remark
that seems worthy of record.&nbsp; For when I asked him if he were Protestant
or Catholic&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I make no shame of my religion.&nbsp;
I am a Catholic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made no shame of it!&nbsp; The phrase is a piece of natural statistics;
for it is the language of one in a minority.&nbsp; I thought with a
smile of Bavile and his dragoons, and how you may ride rough-shod over
a religion for a century, and leave it only the more lively for the
friction.&nbsp; Ireland is still Catholic; the Cevennes still Protestant.&nbsp;
It is not a basketful of law-papers, nor the hoofs and pistol-butts
of a regiment of horse, that can change one tittle of a ploughman&rsquo;s
thoughts.&nbsp; Outdoor rustic people have not many ideas, but such
as they have are hardy plants, and thrive flourishingly in persecution.&nbsp;
One who has grown a long while in the sweat of laborious noons, and
under the stars at night, a frequenter of hills and forests, an old
honest countryman, has, in the end, a sense of communion with the powers
of the universe, and amicable relations towards his God.&nbsp; Like
my mountain Plymouth Brother, he knows the Lord.&nbsp; His religion
does not repose upon a choice of logic; it is the poetry of the man&rsquo;s
experience, the philosophy of the history of his life.&nbsp; God, like
a great power, like a great shining sun, has appeared to this simple
fellow in the course of years, and become the ground and essence of
his least reflections; and you may change creeds and dogmas by authority,
or proclaim a new religion with the sound of trumpets, if you will;
but here is a man who has his own thoughts, and will stubbornly adhere
to them in good and evil.&nbsp; He is a Catholic, a Protestant, or a
Plymouth Brother, in the same indefeasible sense that a man is not a
woman, or a woman not a man.&nbsp; For he could not vary from his faith,
unless he could eradicate all memory of the past, and, in a strict and
not a conventional meaning, change his mind.</p>
<h3>THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY</h3>
<p>I was now drawing near to Cassagnas, a cluster of black roofs upon
the hillside, in this wild valley, among chestnut gardens, and looked
upon in the clear air by many rocky peaks.&nbsp; The road along the
Mimente is yet new, nor have the mountaineers recovered their surprise
when the first cart arrived at Cassagnas.&nbsp; But although it lay
thus apart from the current of men&rsquo;s business, this hamlet had
already made a figure in the history of France.&nbsp; Hard by, in caverns
of the mountain, was one of the five arsenals of the Camisards; where
they laid up clothes and corn and arms against necessity, forged bayonets
and sabres, and made themselves gunpowder with willow charcoal and saltpetre
boiled in kettles.&nbsp; To the same caves, amid this multifarious industry,
the sick and wounded were brought up to heal; and there they were visited
by the two surgeons, Chabrier and Tavan, and secretly nursed by women
of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Of the five legions into which the Camisards were divided, it was
the oldest and the most obscure that had its magazines by Cassagnas.&nbsp;
This was the band of Spirit S&eacute;guier; men who had joined their
voices with his in the 68th Psalm as they marched down by night on the
archpriest of the Cevennes.&nbsp; S&eacute;guier, promoted to heaven,
was succeeded by Salomon Couderc, whom Cavalier treats in his memoirs
as chaplain-general to the whole army of the Camisards.&nbsp; He was
a prophet; a great reader of the heart, who admitted people to the sacrament
or refused them, by &lsquo;intensively viewing every man&rsquo; between
the eyes; and had the most of the Scriptures off by rote.&nbsp; And
this was surely happy; since in a surprise in August 1703, he lost his
mule, his portfolios, and his Bible.&nbsp; It is only strange that they
were not surprised more often and more effectually; for this legion
of Cassagnas was truly patriarchal in its theory of war, and camped
without sentries, leaving that duty to the angels of the God for whom
they fought.&nbsp; This is a token, not only of their faith, but of
the trackless country where they harboured.&nbsp; M. de Caladon, taking
a stroll one fine day, walked without warning into their midst, as he
might have walked into &lsquo;a flock of sheep in a plain,&rsquo; and
found some asleep and some awake and psalm-singing.&nbsp; A traitor
had need of no recommendation to insinuate himself among their ranks,
beyond &lsquo;his faculty of singing psalms&rsquo;; and even the prophet
Salomon &lsquo;took him into a particular friendship.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus,
among their intricate hills, the rustic troop subsisted; and history
can attribute few exploits to them but sacraments and ecstasies.</p>
<p>People of this tough and simple stock will not, as I have just been
saying, prove variable in religion; nor will they get nearer to apostasy
than a mere external conformity like that of Naaman in the house of
Rimmon.&nbsp; When Louis XVI., in the words of the edict, &lsquo;convinced
by the uselessness of a century of persecutions, and rather from necessity
than sympathy,&rsquo; granted at last a royal grace of toleration, Cassagnas
was still Protestant; and to a man, it is so to this day.&nbsp; There
is, indeed, one family that is not Protestant, but neither is it Catholic.&nbsp;
It is that of a Catholic <i>cur&eacute;</i> in revolt, who has taken
to his bosom a schoolmistress.&nbsp; And his conduct, it is worth noting,
is disapproved by the Protestant villagers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a bad idea for a man,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;to go
back from his engagements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The villagers whom I saw seemed intelligent after a countrified fashion,
and were all plain and dignified in manner.&nbsp; As a Protestant myself,
I was well looked upon, and my acquaintance with history gained me further
respect.&nbsp; For we had something not unlike a religious controversy
at table, a gendarme and a merchant with whom I dined being both strangers
to the place, and Catholics.&nbsp; The young men of the house stood
round and supported me; and the whole discussion was tolerantly conducted,
and surprised a man brought up among the infinitesimal and contentious
differences of Scotland.&nbsp; The merchant, indeed, grew a little warm,
and was far less pleased than some others with my historical acquirements.&nbsp;
But the gendarme was mighty easy over it all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad idea for a man to change,&rsquo; said he;
and the remark was generally applauded.</p>
<p>That was not the opinion of the priest and soldier at Our Lady of
the Snows.&nbsp; But this is a different race; and perhaps the same
great-heartedness that upheld them to resist, now enables them to differ
in a kind spirit.&nbsp; For courage respects courage; but where a faith
has been trodden out, we may look for a mean and narrow population.&nbsp;
The true work of Bruce and Wallace was the union of the nations; not
that they should stand apart a while longer, skirmishing upon their
borders; but that, when the time came, they might unite with self-respect.</p>
<p>The merchant was much interested in my journey, and thought it dangerous
to sleep afield.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are the wolves,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;and then it is
known you are an Englishman.&nbsp; The English have always long purses,
and it might very well enter into some one&rsquo;s head to deal you
an ill blow some night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I told him I was not much afraid of such accidents; and at any rate
judged it unwise to dwell upon alarms or consider small perils in the
arrangement of life.&nbsp; Life itself, I submitted, was a far too risky
business as a whole to make each additional particular of danger worth
regard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Something,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;might burst in
your inside any day of the week, and there would be an end of you, if
you were locked into your room with three turns of the key.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Cependant</i>,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;<i>coucher dehors</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is everywhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Cependant, coucher dehors</i>!&rsquo; he repeated, and
his voice was eloquent of terror.</p>
<p>He was the only person, in all my voyage, who saw anything hardy
in so simple a proceeding; although many considered it superfluous.&nbsp;
Only one, on the other hand, professed much delight in the idea; and
that was my Plymouth Brother, who cried out, when I told him I sometimes
preferred sleeping under the stars to a close and noisy ale-house, &lsquo;Now
I see that you know the Lord!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The merchant asked me for one of my cards as I was leaving, for he
said I should be something to talk of in the future, and desired me
to make a note of his request and reason; a desire with which I have
thus complied.</p>
<p>A little after two I struck across the Mimente, and took a rugged
path southward up a hillside covered with loose stones and tufts of
heather.&nbsp; At the top, as is the habit of the country, the path
disappeared; and I left my she-ass munching heather, and went forward
alone to seek a road.</p>
<p>I was now on the separation of two vast water-sheds; behind me all
the streams were bound for the Garonne and the Western Ocean; before
me was the basin of the Rhone.&nbsp; Hence, as from the Loz&egrave;re,
you can see in clear weather the shining of the Gulf of Lyons; and perhaps
from here the soldiers of Salomon may have watched for the topsails
of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, and the long-promised aid from England.&nbsp;
You may take this ridge as lying in the heart of the country of the
Camisards; four of the five legions camped all round it and almost within
view&mdash;Salomon and Joani to the north, Castanet and Roland to the
south; and when Julien had finished his famous work, the devastation
of the High Cevennes, which lasted all through October and November
1703, and during which four hundred and sixty villages and hamlets were,
with fire and pickaxe, utterly subverted, a man standing on this eminence
would have looked forth upon a silent, smokeless, and dispeopled land.&nbsp;
Time and man&rsquo;s activity have now repaired these ruins; Cassagnas
is once more roofed and sending up domestic smoke; and in the chestnut
gardens, in low and leafy corners, many a prosperous farmer returns,
when the day&rsquo;s work is done, to his children and bright hearth.&nbsp;
And still it was perhaps the wildest view of all my journey.&nbsp; Peak
upon peak, chain upon chain of hills ran surging southward, channelled
and sculptured by the winter streams, feathered from head to foot with
chestnuts, and here and there breaking out into a coronal of cliffs.&nbsp;
The sun, which was still far from setting, sent a drift of misty gold
across the hill-tops, but the valleys were already plunged in a profound
and quiet shadow.</p>
<p>A very old shepherd, hobbling on a pair of sticks, and wearing a
black cap of liberty, as if in honour of his nearness to the grave,
directed me to the road for St. Germain de Calberte.&nbsp; There was
something solemn in the isolation of this infirm and ancient creature.&nbsp;
Where he dwelt, how he got upon this high ridge, or how he proposed
to get down again, were more than I could fancy.&nbsp; Not far off upon
my right was the famous Plan de Font Morte, where Poul with his Armenian
sabre slashed down the Camisards of S&eacute;guier.&nbsp; This, methought,
might be some Rip van Winkle of the war, who had lost his comrades,
fleeing before Poul, and wandered ever since upon the mountains.&nbsp;
It might be news to him that Cavalier had surrendered, or Roland had
fallen fighting with his back against an olive.&nbsp; And while I was
thus working on my fancy, I heard him hailing in broken tones, and saw
him waving me to come back with one of his two sticks.&nbsp; I had already
got some way past him; but, leaving Modestine once more, retraced my
steps.</p>
<p>Alas, it was a very commonplace affair.&nbsp; The old gentleman had
forgot to ask the pedlar what he sold, and wished to remedy this neglect.</p>
<p>I told him sternly, &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing?&rsquo; cried he.</p>
<p>I repeated &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; and made off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd to think of, but perhaps I thus became as inexplicable
to the old man as he had been to me.</p>
<p>The road lay under chestnuts, and though I saw a hamlet or two below
me in the vale, and many lone houses of the chestnut farmers, it was
a very solitary march all afternoon; and the evening began early underneath
the trees.&nbsp; But I heard the voice of a woman singing some sad,
old, endless ballad not far off.&nbsp; It seemed to be about love and
a <i>bel amoureux</i>, her handsome sweetheart; and I wished I could
have taken up the strain and answered her, as I went on upon my invisible
woodland way, weaving, like Pippa in the poem, my own thoughts with
hers.&nbsp; What could I have told her?&nbsp; Little enough; and yet
all the heart requires.&nbsp; How the world gives and takes away, and
brings sweethearts near only to separate them again into distant and
strange lands; but to love is the great amulet which makes the world
a garden; and &lsquo;hope, which comes to all,&rsquo; outwears the accidents
of life, and reaches with tremulous hand beyond the grave and death.&nbsp;
Easy to say: yea, but also, by God&rsquo;s mercy, both easy and grateful
to believe!</p>
<p>We struck at last into a wide white high-road carpeted with noiseless
dust.&nbsp; The night had come; the moon had been shining for a long
while upon the opposite mountain; when on turning a corner my donkey
and I issued ourselves into her light.&nbsp; I had emptied out my brandy
at Florac, for I could bear the stuff no longer, and replaced it with
some generous and scented Volnay; and now I drank to the moon&rsquo;s
sacred majesty upon the road.&nbsp; It was but a couple of mouthfuls;
yet I became thenceforth unconscious of my limbs, and my blood flowed
with luxury.&nbsp; Even Modestine was inspired by this purified nocturnal
sunshine, and bestirred her little hoofs as to a livelier measure.&nbsp;
The road wound and descended swiftly among masses of chestnuts.&nbsp;
Hot dust rose from our feet and flowed away.&nbsp; Our two shadows&mdash;mine
deformed with the knapsack, hers comically bestridden by the pack&mdash;now
lay before us clearly outlined on the road, and now, as we turned a
corner, went off into the ghostly distance, and sailed along the mountain
like clouds.&nbsp; From time to time a warm wind rustled down the valley,
and set all the chestnuts dangling their bunches of foliage and fruit;
the ear was filled with whispering music, and the shadows danced in
tune.&nbsp; And next moment the breeze had gone by, and in all the valley
nothing moved except our travelling feet.&nbsp; On the opposite slope,
the monstrous ribs and gullies of the mountain were faintly designed
in the moonshine; and high overhead, in some lone house, there burned
one lighted window, one square spark of red in the huge field of sad
nocturnal colouring.</p>
<p>At a certain point, as I went downward, turning many acute angles,
the moon disappeared behind the hill; and I pursued my way in great
darkness, until another turning shot me without preparation into St.
Germain de Calberte.&nbsp; The place was asleep and silent, and buried
in opaque night.&nbsp; Only from a single open door, some lamplight
escaped upon the road to show me that I was come among men&rsquo;s habitations.&nbsp;
The two last gossips of the evening, still talking by a garden wall,
directed me to the inn.&nbsp; The landlady was getting her chicks to
bed; the fire was already out, and had, not without grumbling, to be
rekindled; half an hour later, and I must have gone supperless to roost.</p>
<h3>THE LAST DAY</h3>
<p>When I awoke (Thursday, 2nd October), and, hearing a great flourishing
of cocks and chuckling of contented hens, betook me to the window of
the clean and comfortable room where I had slept the night, I looked
forth on a sunshiny morning in a deep vale of chestnut gardens.&nbsp;
It was still early, and the cockcrows, and the slanting lights, and
the long shadows encouraged me to be out and look round me.</p>
<p>St. Germain de Calberte is a great parish nine leagues round about.&nbsp;
At the period of the wars, and immediately before the devastation, it
was inhabited by two hundred and seventy-five families, of which only
nine were Catholic; and it took the cur&eacute; seventeen September
days to go from house to house on horseback for a census.&nbsp; But
the place itself, although capital of a canton, is scarce larger than
a hamlet.&nbsp; It lies terraced across a steep slope in the midst of
mighty chestnuts.&nbsp; The Protestant chapel stands below upon a shoulder;
in the midst of the town is the quaint old Catholic church.</p>
<p>It was here that poor Du Chayla, the Christian martyr, kept his library
and held a court of missionaries; here he had built his tomb, thinking
to lie among a grateful population whom he had redeemed from error;
and hither on the morrow of his death they brought the body, pierced
with two-and-fifty wounds, to be interred.&nbsp; Clad in his priestly
robes, he was laid out in state in the church.&nbsp; The <i>cur&eacute;</i>,
taking his text from Second Samuel, twentieth chapter and twelfth verse,
&lsquo;And Amasa wallowed in his blood in the highway,&rsquo; preached
a rousing sermon, and exhorted his brethren to die each at his post,
like their unhappy and illustrious superior.&nbsp; In the midst of this
eloquence there came a breeze that Spirit S&eacute;guier was near at
hand; and behold! all the assembly took to their horses&rsquo; heels,
some east, some west, and the <i>cur&eacute;</i> himself as far as Alais.</p>
<p>Strange was the position of this little Catholic metropolis, a thimbleful
of Rome, in such a wild and contrary neighbourhood.&nbsp; On the one
hand, the legion of Salomon overlooked it from Cassagnas; on the other,
it was cut off from assistance by the legion of Roland at Mialet.&nbsp;
The <i>cur&eacute;</i>, Louvrelenil, although he took a panic at the
arch-priest&rsquo;s funeral, and so hurriedly decamped to Alais, stood
well by his isolated pulpit, and thence uttered fulminations against
the crimes of the Protestants.&nbsp; Salomon besieged the village for
an hour and a half, but was beaten back.&nbsp; The militiamen, on guard
before the <i>cur&eacute;&rsquo;s</i> door, could be heard, in the black
hours, singing Protestant psalms and holding friendly talk with the
insurgents.&nbsp; And in the morning, although not a shot had been fired,
there would not be a round of powder in their flasks.&nbsp; Where was
it gone?&nbsp; All handed over to the Camisards for a consideration.&nbsp;
Untrusty guardians for an isolated priest!</p>
<p>That these continual stirs were once busy in St. Germain de Calberte,
the imagination with difficulty receives; all is now so quiet, the pulse
of human life now beats so low and still in this hamlet of the mountains.&nbsp;
Boys followed me a great way off, like a timid sort of lion-hunters;
and people turned round to have a second look, or came out of their
houses, as I went by.&nbsp; My passage was the first event, you would
have fancied, since the Camisards.&nbsp; There was nothing rude or forward
in this observation; it was but a pleased and wondering scrutiny, like
that of oxen or the human infant; yet it wearied my spirits, and soon
drove me from the street.</p>
<p>I took refuge on the terraces, which are here greenly carpeted with
sward, and tried to imitate with a pencil the inimitable attitudes of
the chestnuts as they bear up their canopy of leaves.&nbsp; Ever and
again a little wind went by, and the nuts dropped all around me, with
a light and dull sound, upon the sward.&nbsp; The noise was as of a
thin fall of great hailstones; but there went with it a cheerful human
sentiment of an approaching harvest and farmers rejoicing in their gains.&nbsp;
Looking up, I could see the brown nut peering through the husk, which
was already gaping; and between the stems the eye embraced an amphitheatre
of hill, sunlit and green with leaves.</p>
<p>I have not often enjoyed a place more deeply.&nbsp; I moved in an
atmosphere of pleasure, and felt light and quiet and content.&nbsp;
But perhaps it was not the place alone that so disposed my spirit.&nbsp;
Perhaps some one was thinking of me in another country; or perhaps some
thought of my own had come and gone unnoticed, and yet done me good.&nbsp;
For some thoughts, which sure would be the most beautiful, vanish before
we can rightly scan their features; as though a god, travelling by our
green highways, should but ope the door, give one smiling look into
the house, and go again for ever.&nbsp; Was it Apollo, or Mercury, or
Love with folded wings?&nbsp; Who shall say?&nbsp; But we go the lighter
about our business, and feel peace and pleasure in our hearts.</p>
<p>I dined with a pair of Catholics.&nbsp; They agreed in the condemnation
of a young man, a Catholic, who had married a Protestant girl and gone
over to the religion of his wife.&nbsp; A Protestant born they could
understand and respect; indeed, they seemed to be of the mind of an
old Catholic woman, who told me that same day there was no difference
between the two sects, save that &lsquo;wrong was more wrong for the
Catholic,&rsquo; who had more light and guidance; but this of a man&rsquo;s
desertion filled them with contempt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a bad idea for a man to change,&rsquo; said one.</p>
<p>It may have been accidental, but you see how this phrase pursued
me; and for myself, I believe it is the current philosophy in these
parts.&nbsp; I have some difficulty in imagining a better.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
not only a great flight of confidence for a man to change his creed
and go out of his family for heaven&rsquo;s sake; but the odds are&mdash;nay,
and the hope is&mdash;that, with all this great transition in the eyes
of man, he has not changed himself a hairbreadth to the eyes of God.&nbsp;
Honour to those who do so, for the wrench is sore.&nbsp; But it argues
something narrow, whether of strength or weakness, whether of the prophet
or the fool, in those who can take a sufficient interest in such infinitesimal
and human operations, or who can quit a friendship for a doubtful process
of the mind.&nbsp; And I think I should not leave my old creed for another,
changing only words for other words; but by some brave reading, embrace
it in spirit and truth, and find wrong as wrong for me as for the best
of other communions.</p>
<p>The phylloxera was in the neighbourhood; and instead of wine we drank
at dinner a more economical juice of the grape&mdash;La Parisienne,
they call it.&nbsp; It is made by putting the fruit whole into a cask
with water; one by one the berries ferment and burst; what is drunk
during the day is supplied at night in water: so, with ever another
pitcher from the well, and ever another grape exploding and giving out
its strength, one cask of Parisienne may last a family till spring.&nbsp;
It is, as the reader will anticipate, a feeble beverage, but very pleasant
to the taste.</p>
<p>What with dinner and coffee, it was long past three before I left
St. Germain de Calberte.&nbsp; I went down beside the Gardon of Mialet,
a great glaring watercourse devoid of water, and through St. Etienne
de Vall&eacute;e Fran&ccedil;aise, or Val Francesque, as they used to
call it; and towards evening began to ascend the hill of St. Pierre.&nbsp;
It was a long and steep ascent.&nbsp; Behind me an empty carriage returning
to St. Jean du Gard kept hard upon my tracks, and near the summit overtook
me.&nbsp; The driver, like the rest of the world, was sure I was a pedlar;
but, unlike others, he was sure of what I had to sell.&nbsp; He had
noticed the blue wool which hung out of my pack at either end; and from
this he had decided, beyond my power to alter his decision, that I dealt
in blue-wool collars, such as decorate the neck of the French draught-horse.</p>
<p>I had hurried to the topmost powers of Modestine, for I dearly desired
to see the view upon the other side before the day had faded.&nbsp;
But it was night when I reached the summit; the moon was riding high
and clear; and only a few grey streaks of twilight lingered in the west.&nbsp;
A yawning valley, gulfed in blackness, lay like a hole in created nature
at my feet; but the outline of the hills was sharp against the sky.&nbsp;
There was Mount Aigoal, the stronghold of Castanet.&nbsp; And Castanet,
not only as an active undertaking leader, deserves some mention among
Camisards; for there is a spray of rose among his laurel; and he showed
how, even in a public tragedy, love will have its way.&nbsp; In the
high tide of war he married, in his mountain citadel, a young and pretty
lass called Mariette.&nbsp; There were great rejoicings; and the bridegroom
released five-and-twenty prisoners in honour of the glad event.&nbsp;
Seven months afterwards, Mariette, the Princess of the Cevennes, as
they called her in derision, fell into the hands of the authorities,
where it was like to have gone hard with her.&nbsp; But Castanet was
a man of execution, and loved his wife.&nbsp; He fell on Valleraugue,
and got a lady there for a hostage; and for the first and last time
in that war there was an exchange of prisoners.&nbsp; Their daughter,
pledge of some starry night upon Mount Aigoal, has left descendants
to this day.</p>
<p>Modestine and I&mdash;it was our last meal together&mdash;had a snack
upon the top of St. Pierre, I on a heap of stones, she standing by me
in the moonlight and decorously eating bread out of my hand.&nbsp; The
poor brute would eat more heartily in this manner; for she had a sort
of affection for me, which I was soon to betray.</p>
<p>It was a long descent upon St. Jean du Gard, and we met no one but
a carter, visible afar off by the glint of the moon on his extinguished
lantern.</p>
<p>Before ten o&rsquo;clock we had got in and were at supper; fifteen
miles and a stiff hill in little beyond six hours!</p>
<h3>FAREWELL, MODESTINE!</h3>
<p>On examination, on the morning of October 3rd, Modestine was pronounced
unfit for travel.&nbsp; She would need at least two days&rsquo; repose,
according to the ostler; but I was now eager to reach Alais for my letters;
and, being in a civilised country of stage-coaches, I determined to
sell my lady friend and be off by the diligence that afternoon.&nbsp;
Our yesterday&rsquo;s march, with the testimony of the driver who had
pursued us up the long hill of St. Pierre, spread a favourable notion
of my donkey&rsquo;s capabilities.&nbsp; Intending purchasers were aware
of an unrivalled opportunity.&nbsp; Before ten I had an offer of twenty-five
francs; and before noon, after a desperate engagement, I sold her, saddle
and all, for five-and-thirty.&nbsp; The pecuniary gain is not obvious,
but I had bought freedom into the bargain.</p>
<p>St Jean du Gard is a large place, and largely Protestant.&nbsp; The
maire, a Protestant, asked me to help him in a small matter which is
itself characteristic of the country.&nbsp; The young women of the Cevennes
profit by the common religion and the difference of the language to
go largely as governesses into England; and here was one, a native of
Mialet, struggling with English circulars from two different agencies
in London.&nbsp; I gave what help I could; and volunteered some advice,
which struck me as being excellent.</p>
<p>One thing more I note.&nbsp; The phylloxera has ravaged the vineyards
in this neighbourhood; and in the early morning, under some chestnuts
by the river, I found a party of men working with a cider-press.&nbsp;
I could not at first make out what they were after, and asked one fellow
to explain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Making cider,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Oui</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est
comme &ccedil;a.&nbsp; Comme dans le nord</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a ring of sarcasm in his voice: the country was going to
the devil.</p>
<p>It was not until I was fairly seated by the driver, and rattling
through a rocky valley with dwarf olives, that I became aware of my
bereavement.&nbsp; I had lost Modestine.&nbsp; Up to that moment I had
thought I hated her; but now she was gone,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And oh!<br />
The difference to me!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For twelve days we had been fast companions; we had travelled upwards
of a hundred and twenty miles, crossed several respectable ridges, and
jogged along with our six legs by many a rocky and many a boggy by-road.&nbsp;
After the first day, although sometimes I was hurt and distant in manner,
I still kept my patience; and as for her, poor soul! she had come to
regard me as a god.&nbsp; She loved to eat out of my hand.&nbsp; She
was patient, elegant in form, the colour of an ideal mouse, and inimitably
small.&nbsp; Her faults were those of her race and sex; her virtues
were her own.&nbsp; Farewell, and if for ever&mdash;</p>
<p>Father Adam wept when he sold her to me; after I had sold her in
my turn, I was tempted to follow his example; and being alone with a
stage-driver and four or five agreeable young men, I did not hesitate
to yield to my emotion.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
